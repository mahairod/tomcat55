ABOUT
-----

The Tomcat redirector was developed using Visual C++ Ver.6.0, 
so having this environment is a prerequisite if you want to perform 
a custom build.

REQUIREMENT
-----------

MS VC 6.0 (+ update, latest service pack is sp5)
MS PLATFORM SDK

BUILDING
--------
 
The steps that you need to take are:

   1. Change directory to the isapi redirector plugins source directory.

   2. Execute the following command:
      MSDEV isapi.dsp /MAKE ALL
      If msdev is not in your path, enter the full path to msdev.exe

This will build both release and debug versions of the redirector plugin.

An alternative will be to open the isapi workspace file (isapi.dsw) in msdev and 
build it using the build menu.
