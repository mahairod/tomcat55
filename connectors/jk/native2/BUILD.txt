Quick informations on building mod_jk2 :

Starting with 2.0.4, APR is mandatory for jk2 so you should be
sure to have it installed on your system, probably because you
allready have an Apache 2.0 installed or have apr and apr-utils
sources tarball ready, since jk2 will first build APR/APR-UTILS
for itw own purpose (Apache 1.3 case).


If you want to have JNI support, add --with-jni and be sure to
have JAVA_HOME env var point to your Java Environnement.

* Linux distributions using Apache 2.0

  You should have apxs, so be sure to have the Apache2 devel rpm, 
  httpd-devel or apache2-devel depending distributions.

./configure --with-apxs2=/your/path/to/apxs --with-jni
make
cp ../build/jk2/apache2/mod_jk2.so /your/path/to/apache2modules 


* Linux distributions using Apache 1.3

  You should have apxs, so be sure to have the Apache devel rpm, 
  httpd-devel or apache-devel depending distributions.

./configure --with-apxs=/your/path/to/apxs 	--with-apr=/your/path/to/aprsources \
            --with-apr-util=/your/patch/to/apr-util --with-jni
make
cp ../build/jk2/apache13/mod_jk2.so /your/path/to/apache13modules 




* IIS 

There is a known issue with the latest APR 1.0 and MSVC6.
If you want to use MSVC6, please use APR 0.9.x for now.
MSVC7 doesnt have this issue, and could be used with APR 1.0.

* Netware

Buid the JK2 connector for NetWare platform.

The current NWNGUmakefile uses the same build system as Apache2 self for NetWare target.
Simply extract the downloaded archive, and follow the guideline which describes compilation of Apache2 self. 

After you have compiled Apache2 (this is mandatory for now since the prebuild process must have finished) 
you can simply call the makefile with 'make -f NWGNUmakefile', this builds the connector for Apache2 in a 
release or debug subdirectory, dependent if you specify to build a debug version or not.

It is recommended to use Metrowerks CodeWarrior compiler for now; although the connector builds with GCC 
for NetWare, it is not tested yet if it works - there are known issues with a bitfied and alignment which 
have to be solved.
