Prerequisites
-------------

The common jk2 code requires APR and
PCRE. Download a suitable version of APR from here:

  http://apr.apache.org/
  
PCRE can be found here:

  http://www.pcre.org/
  
Now you should be able to configure and build the redirector. cd to
jakarta-tomcat-connectors/jk/native2 and

$ autoconf

to generate the configure script. Now  issue a ./configure command
similar to this:

$ ./configure \
        --with-domino=/opt/lotus/notes/50120/linux \
        --with-dsapi=/opt/tomcat/jakarta-tomcat-connectors/jk/native2 \
        --with-apr=/opt/tomcat/apr/apr-0.9.4 \
        --with-apr-util=/opt/tomcat/apr/apr-util-0.9.4

Adjust the paths in the above to suit your setup. Assuming configure
reports no problems do

$ make

to build redirector. Again note and fix any problems that are reported.

If make is successful the redirector will be in

../build/jk2/dsapi/libtomcat2.so

Having built the redirector refer to INSTALL-LINUX.txt for installation
instructions.

Mailing Lists
-------------

There are two mailing lists dedicated to the Domino Tomcat redirector:

domino-tomcat-l:
 http://nomen.tagish.co.uk/mailman/listinfo/domino-tomcat-l

domino-tomcat-l is a general discussion list for issues with the
redirector and also wider Tomcat/Domino integration issues such as
calling the Domino Java API from a Tomcat servlet. I expect it to be
fairly low volume so please subscribe if you're actively using the
redirector. If you have an issue with the redirector please post it to
the list where it will be seen not only by me but by other users who may
be able to help with any problems.

domino-tomcat-announce-l:
 http://nomen.tagish.co.uk/mailman/listinfo/domino-tomcat-announce-l:

domino-tomcat-announce-l is for announcements about the Domino Tomcat
redirector. Mainly this list will be used for new releases but serious
bugs will also be posted to it. This list will be very low volume; only
I can post to it. I wouldn't expect more than a few posts per month. For
this reason if you'd like to keep track of new redirector versions
please subscribe to this list. From now on this list will be the main
place to find out about new versions.

Please let me know if you have any problems.
