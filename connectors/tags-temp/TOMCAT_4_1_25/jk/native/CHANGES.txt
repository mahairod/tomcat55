Last modified at [$Date$]

Changes with JK 1.2.3:
    * Add JkAutoAlias to Apache 2.0
      [glenn]
    * Apache 2/1.3, if Tomcat returns an error but not content,
      let Apache handle processing the error returned by Tomcat.
    * Added the load balancer sticky_session property. If set to 0
      requests with servlet SESSION ID's can be routed to any Tomcat
      worker. Default is 1, sessions are sticky.

Changes with JK 1.2.2:
    * tomcat_trend.pl updated script to support changed logging of 
      aborted requests
      [glenn]
    * jk set correctly the content-type in Apache 2.0,
      making it ready to works with mod_deflate and AddOutputFilterByType 
      [hgomez]
    * jk will check result of get_endpoint and handle a failure.
      This call can fail if the allocation for the endpoint fails because of low memory conditions 
      causing a dereference of NULL when we try and access the endpoint
