<h2>Package org.apache.tomcat.util.prefs</h2>

<p>This package abstract the configuration for tomcat ( or any other
application using a similar 2-layer configuration model ). </p>

<h3>Data storage</h3>

<p>The first layer deals with storing the data. It is modeled after
java.util.prefs, JNDI and other similar config mechanisms - with the 
intention of beeing easily adaptable to any of those. 

<p>It'll use a discovery mechanism ( similar with jaxp, commons loggig )
and should be able to use JDK1.4 prefs, directory servers, Win32 Registry,
XML config files, INI-style config files, properties files ( with a 
naming convention to represent hierarchical information ).

<p>A secondary goal for this package is to allow the config data 
to be 'exposed' as a standard JDK1.4 prefs implementation, so 
(web)applications using JDK1.4 prefs can use the same data store
( but not the same data ! ).

<p>An important consideration is the security and insolation of different
 applications - the current JDK1.4 doesn't provide the fine-grained
security needed for a web environment, and we'll have to provide it
in the implementation. 

<h3>Component configuration</h3>

<p>The second layer supports a Java Bean model for the application
components, similar with tomcat and many other applications.

<p>In addition, this will be closely integrated with JMX, allowing
us to support and persist changes made using JMX on all managed 
components. The only requirement is that changes are made either
using this API, or that the Notification is supported in the 
MBeans ( true for ModelMBeans and any other MBean that chooses to).

<h3>Implementation</h3>
