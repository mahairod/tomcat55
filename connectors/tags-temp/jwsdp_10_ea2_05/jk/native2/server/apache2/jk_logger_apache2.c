/**
 * Description: Logger implementation using apache's native logging.
 *
 * This is the result of lazyness - a single log file to watch ( error.log )
 * instead of 2, no need to explain/document/decide where to place mod_jk
 * logging, etc.
 *
 * Normal apache logging rules apply.
 *
 * XXX Jk will use per/compoment logging level. All logs will be WARN level
 * in apache, and the filtering will happen on each component level.
 *
 * XXX Add file/line
 *
 * XXX Use env, use the current request structure ( so we can split the log
 * based on vhost configs ).
