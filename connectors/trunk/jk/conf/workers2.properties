#################### Channels ####################
# Each channel defines a communication mechanism to a tomcat instance.
# Each channel is associated with a ajp13:NAME, with the same local name


# Default channel 
[channel.socket:localhost:8009]
# lbfactor=1


# Example additional socket channel. The location is in the name ( URL-style
[channel.socket:localhost:8019]


# Example 2 - explicitely set the host/port, the name can be anything.
# [channel.socket:myWorker]
# host=myHost
# port=8109


# Example unix socket.
# XXX We must use an explicit setting to use substitution - resolve this
[channel.apr:unixSocket]
file=${TOMCAT_HOME}/work/jk2.socket


[channel.jni:jni]

#################### Workers ####################
# All non-ajp13 workers or workers with special configurations

# The status worker. 
[worker.status]


# This is created by default - and used for all webapps that don't specify 
# explicitely an worker.
# It'll automatically get all the 'forwarding' workers/channels.
# [worker.lb]


# Note that we use separate lines instead of , separated values. 
# This is also created by default - when a forwarding worker has a 
# 'group' property
# [worker.lb:group1]


# Requirements: libjvm.so MUST BE INCLUDED in LD_LIBRARY_PATH for this 
# to work reliably and on all platforms. Same for other java libs. 
# "java" script is a good example, Sun needs it to start java and we need it to.
# JAVA_HOME and TOMCAT_HOME can be set as environment variables
[disabled:vm]
# That will work with both 3.x and 4.x.

#################### Locations #################### 
# XXX Uris to be read from separate file, one per webapp.
# XXX Webapps to be declared automatically, using webapps/ content :-)


### Virtual host definitions ( in the vhost directory ) 
# No '/' in the name. 
# It _must_ be defined for each virtual host ( or bad things will happen in jk2.0, 
# later we might forgive you ) ( either manually or automatically )

[uri:localhost:8080]
alias=127.0.0.1:8080
alias=myLocalHost:8080

### Webapps definitions ( in each webapp )
# The name and context are equals ( that's how we know it's a context definition )
# Must be defined 

[uri:/examples]
context=/examples

[uri:localhost:8080/examples]
context=/examples

# Status worker. XXX protect it with <Location> and security settings,
# it'll display all properties - including eventual secrets.
# 
[uri:/jkstatus]
context=/jkstatus

### Per/uri mappings

# Exact mapping
[uri:/examples/servlet/RequestHeaderExample]

# Prefix mapping
[uri:/examples/servlet/RequestInfoExample/*]

# Extension match
[uri:/examples/*.jsp]

[uri:/jkstatus/*]
worker=worker.status:

## No other forms of mappings are currently supported
# Because the spec doesn't support them.
