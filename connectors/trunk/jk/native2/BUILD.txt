Quick informations on building mod_jk2 :

Starting with 2.0.4, APR is mandatory for jk2 so you should be
sure to have it installed on your system, probably because you
allready have an Apache 2.0 installed or have apr and apr-utils
sources tarball ready, since jk2 will first build APR/APR-UTILS
for itw own purpose (Apache 1.3 case).


If you want to have JNI support, add --with-jni and be sure to
have JAVA_HOME env var point to your Java Environnement.

* Linux distributions using Apache 2.0

  You should have apxs, so be sure to have the Apache2 devel rpm, 
  httpd-devel or apache2-devel depending distributions.

./configure --with-apxs2=/your/path/to/apxs --with-jni
make
cp ../build/jk2/apache2/mod_jk2.so /your/path/to/apache2modules 


* Linux distributions using Apache 1.3

  You should have apxs, so be sure to have the Apache devel rpm, 
  httpd-devel or apache-devel depending distributions.

./configure --with-apxs=/your/path/to/apxs 	--with-apr=/your/path/to/aprsources \
            --with-apr-util=/your/patch/to/apr-util --with-jni
make
cp ../build/jk2/apache13/mod_jk2.so /your/path/to/apache13modules 




* IIS 

There is a known issue with the latest APR 1.0 and MSVC6.
If you want to use MSVC6, please use APR 0.9.x for now.
MSVC7 doesnt have this issue, and could be used with APR 1.0.
