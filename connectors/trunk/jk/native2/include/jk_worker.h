/*
 * The worker 'class', which represents something to which the web server
 * can delegate requests. 
 *
 * This can mean communicating with a particular servlet engine instance,
 * using a particular protocol.  A single web server instance may have
 * multiple workers communicating with a single servlet engine (it could be
 * using ajp12 for some requests and ajp13/ajp14 for others).  Or, a single web
 * server instance could have multiple workers communicating with different
 * servlet engines using the same protocol (it could be load balancing
 * among many engines, using ajp13/ajp14 for all communication).
 *
 * There is also a load balancing worker (jk_lb_worker.c), which itself
 * manages a group of workers.
 *
 * Web servers are configured to forward requests to a given worker.  To
 * handle those requests, the worker's get_endpoint method is called, and
 * then the service() method of that endpoint is called.
 *
 * As with all the core jk classes, this is essentially an abstract base
 * class which is implemented/extended by classes which are specific to a
 * particular protocol (or request-handling system).  By using an abstract
 * base class in this manner, plugins can be written for different servers
 * (e.g. IIS, Apache) without the plugins having to worry about which
 * protocol they are talking.
 *
 * This particular OO-in-C system uses a 'worker_private' pointer to
 * point to the protocol-specific data/functions.  So in the subclasses, the
 * methods do most of their work by getting their hands on the
 * worker_private pointer and then using that to get at the functions for
 * their protocol.
 *
 * Try imagining this as a 'public abstract class', and the
 * worker_private pointer as a sort of extra 'this' reference.  Or
 * imagine that you are seeing the internal vtables of your favorite OO
 * language.  Whatever works for you.
 *
 * See jk_ajp14_worker.c, jk_ajp13_worker.c and jk_ajp12_worker.c for examples.
