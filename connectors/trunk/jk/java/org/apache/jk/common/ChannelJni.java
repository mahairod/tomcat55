     *  sendPacket will move the thread execution on the C side, and
     *  return when another packet is available. For packets that
     *  are one way it'll return after it is processed too ( having
     *  2 threads is far more expensive ).
     *
     *  Again, the goal is to be efficient and behave like all other
     *  Channels ( so the rest of the code can be shared ). Playing with
     *  java objects on C is extremely difficult to optimize and do
     *  right ( IMHO ), so we'll try to keep it simple - byte[] passing,
     *  the conversion done in java ( after we know the encoding and
     *  if anyone asks for it - same lazy behavior as in 3.3 ).
