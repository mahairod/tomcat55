<p>
  This document describes the configuration files used by JK2 on the
  Tomcat and Web Server side:
    <ul>
    <li>
    <b>jk2.properties</b> is used on the Tomcat side. It's installation path in
    the $TOMCAT_HOME/conf directory.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>workers2.properties</b> is used on the webserver side. For the Apache
    servers the default path is in the ServerRoot/conf directory.
    </li>
    </ul>    
  Although JK2 has many things in common with mod_jk, the configuration is quite
  different, and all the directives should be inside the workers2.properties.
  This enables JK2 to have the same configuration file no mater what the web server
  it's connected to.

<section name="Minimum Configuration">
<p>
    Minimum configuration is the simplest one to make the JK2 working. The used
    channel will be socket, and lot of options are used by default. Both the
    Tomcat and web server are on the same computer.
</p>
<p>
jk2.properties:
<source>
# The default port is 8009 but you can use onother one
# channelSocket.port=8019
</source>
That is all needed on the Tomcat side to configure the JK2.
</p>
<p>
workers2.properties:
<source>
# Define the comunication channel 
[channel.socket:localhost:8009]
info=Ajp13 forwarding over socket
tomcatId=localhost:8009

# Map the Tomcat examples webapp to the Web server uri space
[uri:/examples/*]
info=Map the whole webapp
</source>
</p>
<p>
Start the Tomcat and Web server and browse to the <a>http://localhost/examples/</a>
