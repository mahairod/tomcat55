  <section name="What is the mod_jk Module">

    <p>
      <b>mod_jk2</b> is originated back to the old <b>mod_jserv</b>.
      <b>mod_jk2</b> is a rewrite of <b>mod_jk</b>.
      The native part has been completly
      restructured and the configuration has been simplified a lot.
    </p>

  </section>

  <section name="Why should I use the mod_jk2 Module?">

    <p>
      Because it offers a lot of different and flexible communications
      between a Web Server and the Tomcat Servlet Engine. 
    </p>

<!-- Pier's mod_webapp text we need our building.xml
    <p>
      If instead you're an adventurous geek who's up for a challenge, skip
      the rest of this document and go to the <a href="building.xml"/>
      section, there's where the fun starts.

  <section name="Are there alternative ways to connect Apache and Tomcat?">

    <p>
      The alternative ways are better described in <b>mod_webapp</b>
      documentation.
      Check there for it and then decide if you want to go on reading. 
      The big advantage of <b>mod_webapp</b> is that is very easy to configure,
      has a well defined protocol named <b>WARP</b>, does not care about the old
      crappy protocols used in Tomcat-3.x and so.
      But it would be possible to implement the <b>WARP</b> protocol in
      <b>mod_jk2</b> ;-))
