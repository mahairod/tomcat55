PROJECT MOO SOURCE TREE (AKA MICRO TEST HARNESS)
================================================

This is the source code tree for Project Moo. Project Moo a micro test
harness designed for lightweight testing duties.

The way moo works is that is reads a list of client classes (which
are the test classes to run). Then it instantiates each class, one
by one and calls a 'runTest' method on it. The 'runTest' method
returns the result in an Object of the type TestResult. The harness
prints out the message field of this Object.

All the client classes use some utility classes provided in moo.
For example, some classes help clients connect to a specific 
server at a specific port. Some classes help forming a query string,
while others help compare two html files.

Currently jakarta-check framework is using moo harness. Please download
jakarta-check workspace and build and run appropriate scripts to get
more insight into how moo works.
