  <section name="How to read the report">
    
    <p>
      The columns in this report contain the following information:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Priority</b> - A sense of how important it is to address this 
        issue in the short term.</li>
      <li><b>Action Item</b> - Concise description of the action item
        to be completed.  Where relevant, Java package names of the
        primary classes involved are listed in [square brackets]</li>
      <li><b>Volunteers</b> - Login of those developers who
        have volunteered to assist in the design, implementation, testing, and
        documentation of this action item's changes to Tomcat.</li>
    </ul>
      Developers can nominate
      themselves to work on particular action items by asking a Committer to 
      add their name address to those items.  The developers 
      working on each item should discuss and agree upon the approach to be 
      used for implementing the item's changes to the project source code 
      and documentation, prior to completing those changes.  Such discussions 
      should take place on the tomcat-dev mailing list so that everyone can 
      stay apprised of what is going on, or chime in if they want to 
      contribute ideas and suggestions.
