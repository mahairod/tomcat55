<section name="Introduction">
  A cluster manager is an extension to Tomcat's session manager interface, 
  <code>org.apache.catalina.Manager</code>
  A cluster manager must implement the <code>org.apache.catalina.ha.ClusterManager</code> and is solely 
  responsible for how the session is replicated.<br/>
  There are currently two different managers, the <code>org.apache.catalina.ha.session.DeltaManager</code> replicates deltas 
  of session data to all members in the cluster. This implementation is proven and works very well, but has a limitation
  as it requires the cluster members to be homogeneous, all nodes must deploy the same applications and be exact replicas.
  The <code>org.apache.catalina.ha.session.BackupManager</code> also replicates deltas but only to one backup node.
  The location of the backup node is known to all nodes in the cluster. It also supports heterogeneous deployments,
  so the manager knows at what locations the webapp is deployed.<br/>
  We are planning to add more managers with even more sophisticated backup mechanism to support even larger clusters.
  Check back soon!

      Set to true if you wish sessions to be replicated only to members that have the same logical
