  Subsection ordering:

  Extras, Tribes, jdbc-pool, Other

  Item Ordering:

  Fixes having an issue number are sorted by their number, ascending.

  There is no ordering by add/update/fix/scode.

  Other fixed issues are added to the end of the list, chronologically.
  They eventually become mixed with the numbered issues. (I.e., numbered
  issues do not "pop up" wrt. others).

  <subsection name="Catalina">
    <changelog>
      <scode>
        Refactor creation of <code>MapperListener</code> to ensure that the
        <code>Mapper</code> used is the <code>Mapper</code> associated with the
        <code>Service</code> for which the listener was created. (markt)
      </scode>
      <add>
        Move the functionality that provides redirects for context roots and
        directories where a trailing <code>/</code> is added from the Mapper to
        the <code>DefaultServlet</code>. This enables such requests to be
        processed by any configured Valves and Filters before the redirect is
        made. This behaviour is configurable via the
        <code>mapperContextRootRedirectEnabled</code> and
        <code>mapperDirectoryRedirectEnabled</code> attributes of the Context
        which may be used to restore the previous behaviour. (markt)
      </add>
      <scode>
        Refactor <code>Service.getContainer()</code> to return an
        <code>Engine</code> rather than a <code>Container</code>. (markt)
      </scode>
      <fix>
        <bug>34319</bug>: Only load those keys in <code>StoreBase.processExpire</code>
        from JDBCStore, that are old enough, to be expired. Based on a patch
        by Tom Anderson. (fschumacher)
      </fix>
      <fix>
        <bug>58629</bug>: Allow an embedded Tomcat instance to start when the
        <code>Service</code> has no <code>Engine</code> configured. (markt)
      </fix>
      <fix>
        Correctly notify the MapperListener associated with a Service if the
        Engine for that Service is changed. (markt)
      </fix>
      <add>
        Make a web application's CredentialHandler available through a context
        attribute. This allows a web application to use the same algorithm
        for validating or generating new stored credentials from cleartext
        ones. (schultz)
      </add>

    <changelog>
      <fix>
        Correct evaluation of system property <code>org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.onlyAttemptCurrentClassLoader</code>.
        It was basically ignored before. Reported by coverity scan. (fschumacher)

      </update>
      <update>
        Tighten up the default file permissions for the <code>.tar.gz</code>
        distribution so no files or directories are world readable by default.
        Configure Tomcat to run with a default umask of <code>0027</code> which
        may be overridden by setting <code>UMASK</code> in
        <code>setenv.sh</code>. (markt)
      </update>

        <bug>57108</bug>: Add support for Server Name Indication (SNI). There
        has been significant changes to the SSL configuration in server.xml to
        support this. (markt)
      </add>
      <add>
        Add SSL engine for JSSE backed by OpenSSL. Includes ALPN support.
        Based on code contributed by Numa de Montmollin and derived from code
        developed by Twitter and Netty. (remm)
      </add>
      <fix>
        RFC 7230 states that clients should ignore reason phrases in HTTP/1.1
        response messages. Since the reason phrase is optional, Tomcat no longer
        sends it. As a result the system property
        <code>org.apache.coyote.USE_CUSTOM_STATUS_MSG_IN_HEADER</code> is no
        longer used and has been removed. (markt)
      </fix>
      <update>
        The minimum required Tomcat Native version has been increased to 1.2.2.

        HTTP/2. (markt)
