<p>Tomcat provides support for WebSocket as defined by
   <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455">RFC 6455</a>.</p>
</section>

<section name="Application development">
<p>Tomcat implements the Java WebSocket 1.0 API defined by <a
   href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=356">JSR-356</a>.</p>

<p>There are several example applications that demonstrate how the WebSocket API
   can be used. You will need to look at both the client side <a
   href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/tomcat/trunk/webapps/examples/websocket/">
   html</a> and the server side <a
   href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/tomcat/trunk/webapps/examples/WEB-INF/classes/websocket/">
   code</a>.</p>

<section name="Tomcat WebSocket specific configuration">
<p>Tomcat provides a number of Tomcat specific configuration options for
   WebSocket. It is anticipated that these will be absorbed into the WebSocket
   specification over time.</p>

<p>The write timeout used when sending WebSocket messages in blocking mode
   defaults to 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds). This may be changed by setting
   the property <code>org.apache.tomcat.websocket.BLOCKING_SEND_TIMEOUT</code>
   in the user properties collection attached to the WebSocket session. The
   value assigned to this property should be a <code>Long</code> and represents
   the timeout to use in milliseconds. For an infinite timeout, use
   <code>-1</code>.</p>
