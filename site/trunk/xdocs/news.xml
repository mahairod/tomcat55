<h3>05 January 2001 - Tomcat 4.0 Beta 1 Release</h3>

<p>The newest release of Tomcat 4.0 <strong>beta 1</strong> is now
available at the 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-tomcat-4.0/release/v4.0-b1/">
Jakarta web site</a>. This release is the first in a series of betas that will 
lead to a production quality release of Tomcat 4.0 later this year. At the 
same time, active development work on Tomcat 4.1 will begin.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> - While the code for Tomcat 4.0 running in stand alone
mode is considered to be near production quality, the web connector to run
behind Apache is still alpha quality code, with limited functionality.  It
is likely that there will be interim updates of the web connector software
in between beta releases of the entire Tomcat 4.0 package.</p>
