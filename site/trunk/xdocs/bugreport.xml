<section name="Before you report a bug">
<p>The Tomcat community consists of those who use Tomcat, help answer
questions on discussions lists, contribute documentation and patches,
and those who develop and maintain the code for Tomcat.  Almost all those
who assist on a day to day basis resolving bug reports do this for a
wide variety of reasons, and almost all of them do this on their own time.</p>

<p>If you have a verified security bug to report please do not post it
to email lists or submit a bug report.  Security bugs should be reported
privately by email to <a href="mailto:security@apache.org">security@apache.org</a>.
</p>

<p>Many bugs reported end up not being a bug in the Tomcat code, but are
due to misconfiguration, problems caused by installed applications, the
operating system, etc.
<ul>
<b>Before reporting a bug please make every effort to resolve the problem
yourself.</b>
</ul>
The remainder of this document points you toward resources you can use to
resolve the problem you are having.
</p>
</section>

<section name="Resources to help resolve Tomcat problems">
<p>Here are some resources you can use to help you resolve the
problem you are having before reporting a bug.</p>

  <subsection name="Problem trouble shooting">
    <p>
    <li><b>Documentation</b> - Review the documentation for the version
      of Tomcat you are using.  The problem you are having may already
      be addressed in the docs.</li>
    <li><b>Logs</b> - The logs which Tomcat generates can be a valuable
      resource when trying to diagnose a problem.  Please review them.
      You may want to enable debug output in your Tomcat configuration
      so that you have more information to help diagnose the problem.</li>
    <li><b>FAQ's</b> - Search Frequently Asked Question documents. FAQ's
      for all Jakarta projects can be found
      <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/faqs.html">here</a>.</li>
    </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection name="Bug Database">
    <p>Please search the bug database to see if the bug you are
      seeing has already been reported.
      <ul>
        <li>The bug may have already been fixed and is available in a later
        version or nightly build.</li>
        <li>Someone else may have reported the bug, you could add supporting
        information to help reproduce and resolve the bug.</li>
      </ul>
      Search the Tomcat 3 bug database
      <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/query.cgi?product=Tomcat%203">
      here</a>.<br />
      Search the Tomcat 4 bug database
      <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/query.cgi?product=Tomcat%204">
      here</a>.<br />
    </p>

  <subsection name="Tomcat discussion lists">
    <p>It is very likely you are not the first to run into a problem.
      Others may have already found a solution.  The <b>tomcat-user</b>
      or <b>tomcat-dev</b> list archives may contain discussions which
      will help you resolve the problem.
      Here are four resources to view the Tomcat User List archives:
       <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=tomcat-user&amp;r=1&amp;w=2">Mailing list ARChives</a>,
       <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/SummarizeList?listName=tomcat-user@jakarta.apache.org">Eyebrowse</a>,
       <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/tomcat-user@jakarta.apache.org">Mail Archive</a>,
       and <a href="http://mikal.org/interests/java/tomcat/">mikal.org</a>.

      Here are four resources to view the Tomcat Developer List archives
      <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=tomcat-dev&amp;r=1&amp;w=2">Mailing list ARChives</a>,
      <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/SummarizeList?listName=tomcat-dev@jakarta.apache.org">Eyebrowse</a>,
      <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/tomcat-dev@jakarta.apache.org/">Mail Archive</a>,
      and <a href="http://www.metronet.com/~wjm/tomcat/">Texas Metronet</a>.

    <p>If you have already subscribed to the
      <a href="mailto:tomcat-user@jakarta.apache.org">tomcat-user</a>
      or <a href="mailto:tomcat-dev@jakarta.apache.org">tomcat-dev</a>
      discussion lists you can ask about the problem on those lists.
      If you are not subscribed, you can learn about the lists and subscribe

<section name="Reporting a Tomcat bug">
<p>If after you have exhausted all other resources to resolve a problem
with Tomcat you may want to file a bug report.  Please make sure the
problem is a bug in Tomcat and not a bug in your web application.</p>

<p>Please make sure you provide as much information as possible. Its
very hard to fix a bug if the person looking into the problem can't
reproduce it.  Here is a listing of information which should be included:
<ul>
  <li><b>Version</b> - Tomcat version, if from a nightly build, version
    and date of build.</li>
  <li><b>Tomcat component</b> - Tomcat component which has the bug.</li>
  <li><b>Platform</b> - Hardward platform Tomcat is running on.</li>
  <li><b>OS</b> - Computer operating system and version.</li>
  <li><b>JVM</b> - JVM Version</li>
  <li><b>Web Server</b> - Web Server and version, Tomcat Connector and version.</li>
  <li><b>Configuration</b> - Attach configuration files if they would help track
    down the bug.</li>
  <li><b>Log file excerpts</b> - Review your logs files, reproduce the bug with
    debugging enabled in your Tomcat configuration.  Then submit any relevant
    sections of the log which help document the bug.</li>
  <li><b>Stack Traces</b> - Any stack traces generated by the bug.</li>
  <li><b>Example</b> - Example configuration files or web applications which
    demonstrate the bug.  When submitting an example which reproduces the bug,
    please try to make it as simple as possible.</li>
  <li><b>Bug Fix Patch</b> - A patch created using <code>diff -u</code> which
    fixes the bug.
    (If you have found a bug fix which can be applied to the Tomcat code)</li>
  <li><b>Miscellaneous</b> - Any other information you feel will help track
    down the problem.  For example other Java API's and versions being used
    with Tomcat.</li>
</ul>
