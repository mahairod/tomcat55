<section name="The Tomcat Story">
<p>The Tomcat projects started at <a href="http://www.sun.com">Sun Microsystems</a> as the reference
implementation of the Java Servlet and Java Server Pages Specifications.  The 
<a href="http://www.jcp.org">Java Community Process (JCP)</a> site contains all the details
of those specifications.
</p>
<p>The Tomcat code base was donated by Sun to the Apache Software Foundation in 1999, and
the first Apache release was version 3.0.  Since then, multiple volunteers from Sun and
numerous other organizations have contributed to the product.  There have been 
<a href="whichversion.html">multiple major releases</a> and the product has enjoyed
considerable industry adoption as well as a healthy and active community.
</p>
<p>In 2005, Tomcat became its own top-level Apache project, leaving the Jakarta umbrella
and oversight structure to manage itself.
