<p>Tomcat is the servlet container that is used in the official
Reference Implementation for the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlets">Java Servlet</a> and <a 
href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp">JavaServer Pages</a> technologies.  
The Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages specifications are developed by Sun 
under the <a href="http://java.sun.com/aboutJava/communityprocess/">Java 
Community Process</a>.  </p> 

<p>Tomcat is developed in an open and participatory environment and 
released under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses">Apache 
Software License</a>.  Tomcat is intended to be a collaboration of the 
best-of-breed developers from around the world.  We invite you to 
participate in this open development project.  To learn more about getting

<section name="Tomcat Versions">
<p>For the impatient, current Tomcat production quality releases vs.
Servlet/JSP specifications:</p>

<p>The releases are described in more detail below to help you determine 
which one is right for you.  More details about each release can be found in 
the associated release notes.</p> 

<p>Please note that alhough we offer downloads and documentation of older
releases, such as Tomcat 3.x and 4.x, we strongly encourage users to use the
latest stable version of Tomcat whenever possible.  We recognize that upgrading
across major version may not be a trivial task, and some support is still
offered on the mailing list for users of old versions.  However, because of the
community-driven support approach, the older your version the less people would
be interested or able to support you.
</p>

<subsection name="Tomcat 5.x">

<p><strong>Tomcat 5.5.x</strong>.  Tomcat 5.5 is the current focus of
development.  While it supports the same Servlet and JSP
Specification versions as Tomcat 5.0.x, there are significant changes
in many areas under the hood, resulting in improved performance, stability,
and total cost of ownership.  Please refer to the Tomcat 5.5 Changelog
for details.
</p>

<p><strong>Tomcat 5.0.x</strong>.  Tomcat 5.0 improves on Tomcat 4.1 in many
ways, including:
<ul>
<li>Performance optimizations and reduced garbage collection</li>
<li>Refactored application deployer, with an optional standalone deployer 
allowing validation and compilation of a web application before putting 
it in production</li>
<li>Complete server monitoring using JMX and the manager web application</li>
<li>Scalability and reliability enhancements</li>
<li>Improved Taglibs handling, including advanced pooling and tag plugins</li>
<li>Improved platform integration, with native Windows and Unix wrappers</li>
<li>Embedding of Tomcat using JMX</li>
<li>Enhanced Security Manager support</li>
<li>Integrated session clustering</li>
<li>Expanded documentation</li>
</ul>
</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Tomcat 4.x">

<p><strong>Tomcat 4.x</strong> implements a new servlet container (called
Catalina) that is based on completely new architecture.  The 4.x releases
implement the <strong>Servlet 2.3</strong> and <strong>JSP 1.2</strong>
specifications.</p>

<p><strong>We encourage all users to upgrade to Tomcat 5.x whenever
possible.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tomcat 4.1.x</strong>. Tomcat 4.1 is a refactoring 
of Tomcat 4.0.x, and contains significant enhancements, including:
<ul>
<li>JMX based administration features</li>
<li>JSP and Struts based administration web application</li>
<li>New Coyote connector (HTTP/1.1, AJP 1.3 and JNI support)</li>
<li>Rewritten Jasper JSP page compiler</li>
<li>Performance and memory efficiency improvements</li>
<li>Enhanced manager application support for integration with development 
tools</li>
<li>Custom Ant tasks to interact with the manager application directly 
from build.xml scripts</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><strong>Tomcat 4.0.x</strong>.  Tomcat 4.0.6 is the old production
quality release.  The 4.0 servlet
container (Catalina) has been developed from the ground up for flexibility and
performance.  Version 4.0 implements the final released versions of the Servlet
2.3 and JSP 1.2 specifications.  As required by the specifications, Tomcat 4.0
also supports web applications built for the Servlet 2.2 and JSP 1.1
specifications with no changes.</p>

<p><strong>We encourage all users to upgrade to Tomcat 5.x whenever
possible.</strong></p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Tomcat 3.x">

<p>There are several versions of <strong>Tomcat 3.x</strong> currently
available for download:</p>

<ul>
<li>Version <strong>3.3</strong> is the current production quality release for
the Servlet 2.2 and JSP 1.1 specifications.  Tomcat 3.3 is the latest
continuation of the Tomcat 3.x architecture and it is more advanced then 3.2.4,
which is the 'old' production quality release.</li>
<li>Version 3.2.4 is the 'old' production quality release and is now in
maintenance only mode.</li>
<li>Version 3.1.1 is a legacy release.</li>
</ul>

<p>
All <strong>Tomcat 3.x</strong> releases trace their heritage back to the
original Servlet and JSP implementations that Sun donated to the Apache
Software Foundation.  The 3.x versions all implement the <strong>Servlet
2.2</strong> and <strong>JSP 1.1</strong> specifications.
</p>

<p><strong>Tomcat 3.3.x</strong>. Version 3.3.2 is the current production 
quality release. It continues the refactoring that was begun in version 3.2 and
carries it to its logical conclusion.  Version 3.3 provides a much more modular
design and allows the servlet container to be customized by adding and removing
modules that control the processing of servlet requests.  This version also
contains many performance improvements.</p> 

<p><strong>Tomcat 3.2.x</strong>.  Version 3.2 added few new features 
since 3.1; the major effort was a refactoring of the internals to improve 
performance and stability.  The 3.2.1 release, like 3.1.1, was a security 
patch.  Version 3.2.2 fixed a large number of bugs and all known 
specification compliance issues.  Version 3.2.3 was a security update that 
closes a serious security hole.  Version 3.2.4 is a minor bug fix release.  
All users of Tomcat versions prior to 3.2.3 should updgrade as soon as 
possible.  With the exception of fixes for critical security related bugs, 
development on the Tomcat 3.2.x branch has stopped.</p> 

<p><strong>Tomcat 3.1.x</strong>.  The 3.1 release contained several 
improvements over Tomcat 3.0, including servlet reloading, WAR file 
support and added connectors for the IIS and Netscape web servers.  The 
latest maintenance release, 3.1.1, contained fixes for security problems.  
There is no active development ongoing for Tomcat 3.1.x.  Users of Tomcat 
3.1 should update to 3.1.1 to close the security holes and they are 
strongly encouraged to migrate to the current production release, Tomcat 
3.3.</p> 

<p><strong>Tomcat 3.0.x</strong>. Initial Tomcat release.</p>

<p><strong>We encourage all users to upgrade to Tomcat 5.x whenever
possible.</strong></p>
