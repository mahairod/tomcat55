<p>Tomcat is the official Reference Implementation for the <a 
href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlets">Java Servlet</a> and <a 
href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp">JavaServer Pages</a> technologies.  
The Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages specifications are developed by Sun 
under the <a href="http://java.sun.com/aboutJava/communityprocess/">Java 
Community Process</a>.  </p> 

<p>Tomcat is developed in an open and participatory environment and 
released under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses">Apache 
Software License</a>.  Tomcat is intended to be a collaboration of the 
best-of-breed developers from around the world.  We invite you to 
participate in this open development project.  To learn more about getting

<section name="Tomcat Versions">
<p>There are several versions of Tomcat currently available for download.  Version 3.1.1
is a legacy release.  Version 3.2.3 is the current production quality release.  Tomcat 3.3
is the latest continuation of the Tomcat 3.x architecture.  All Tomcat 3.x releases
trace their heritage back to the original Servlet and JSP implementations that Sun
donated to the Apache Software Foundation.  The 3.x versions all implement the
Servlet 2.2 and JSP 1.1 specifications.  
</p>

<p>Tomcat 4.0 implements a new servlet container ( called Catalina) that 
is based on completely new architecture.  The 4.x releases will implement 
the Servlet 2.3 and JSP 1.2 specifications.  </p> 

<p>The releases are described in more detail below to help you determine 
which one is right for you.  More details about each release can be found in 
the associated release notes.  </p> 

<p><strong>Tomcat 3.1.x</strong>.  The 3.1 release contained several 
improvements over Tomcat 3.0, including servlet reloading, WAR file 
support and added connectors for the IIS and Netscape web servers.  The 
latest maintenance release, 3.1.1, contained fixes for security problems.  
There is no active development ongoing for Tomcat 3.1.x.  Users of Tomcat 
3.1 should update to 3.1.1 to close the security holes and they are 
strongly encouraged to migrate to the current production release, Tomcat 
3.2.3.</p> 

<p><strong>Tomcat 3.2.x</strong>.  Tomcat 3.2.3 is the current production 
quality release.  Version 3.2 added few new features; the major effort was 
a refactoring of the internals to improve performance and stability.  The 
3.2.1 release, like 3.1.1, was a security patch.  Version 3.2.2 fixed a 
large number of bugs and all known specification compliance issues.  Version
3.2.3 is a security update that closes a serious security hole.  All users
of Tomcat versions prior to 3.2.3 should updgrade as soon as possible.  The 
3.2.x branch will continue in maintenance mode, but no new feature 
releases are planned.</p> 

<p><strong>Tomcat 3.3</strong>.  Tomcat 3.3 continues the refactoring that 
was begun in version 3.2 and carries it to its logical conclusion.  
Version 3.3 provides a much more modular design and allows the servlet 
container to be customized by adding and removing modules that control the 
processing of servlet requests.  This version also contains many 
performance improvements.  Version 3.3 is currently under development and 
the beta process is expected to begin shortly.</p> 

<p><strong>Tomcat 4.0</strong>.  Tomcat 4.0 is the next generatation of 
Tomcat.  The 4.0 servlet container (Catalina) has been developed from the 
ground up for flexibility and performance.  Version 4.0 implements the 
Servlet 2.3 and JSP 1.2 specifications.  These specifications are 
currently in public review and may change before their final publication.  
Tomcat 4.0 is currently undergoing beta testing, but the final release is 
dependant on the finalization of the specifications.</p>
