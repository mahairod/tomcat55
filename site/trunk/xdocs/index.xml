<p>Tomcat is the servlet container that is used in the official
Reference Implementation for the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlets">Java Servlet</a> and <a 
href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp">JavaServer Pages</a> technologies.  
The Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages specifications are developed by Sun 
under the <a href="http://java.sun.com/aboutJava/communityprocess/">Java 
Community Process</a>.  </p> 

<p>Tomcat is developed in an open and participatory environment and 
released under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses">Apache

<subsection name="Tomcat 5.x">

<p><strong>Tomcat 5.x</strong> is the upcoming major release of Tomcat, and
builds upon the Tomcat 3.3 and Tomcat 4.1 codebases. 
The 5.x releases implement the <strong>Servlet 2.4</strong> 
and <strong>JSP 2.0</strong> specifications.</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Tomcat 4.x">

<p><strong>Tomcat 4.x</strong> implements a new servlet container (called
Catalina) that is based on completely new architecture.  The 4.x releases
implement the <strong>Servlet 2.3</strong> and <strong>JSP 1.2</strong>
specifications.</p>

<p><strong>Tomcat 4.1.x</strong>.  Tomcat 4.1.8 Beta is the latest release.  
Tomcat 4.1 is a refactoring of Tomcat 4.0.x, and contains significant 
enhancements, including:
<ul>
<li>JMX based administration features</li>
<li>JSP and Struts based administration web application</li>
<li>New Coyote connector (HTTP/1.1, AJP 1.3 and JNI support)</li>
<li>Rewritten Jasper JSP page compiler</li>
<li>Performance and memory efficiency improvements</li>
<li>Enhanced manager application support for integration with development 
tools</li>
<li>Custom Ant tasks to interact with the manager application directly 
from build.xml scripts</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><strong>Tomcat 4.0.x</strong>.  Tomcat 4.0.4 is the current production
quality release.  Tomcat 4.0 is the next generation of Tomcat.  The 4.0 servlet
container (Catalina) has been developed from the ground up for flexibility and
performance.  Version 4.0 implements the final released versions of the Servlet
2.3 and JSP 1.2 specifications.  As required by the specifications, Tomcat 4.0
also supports web applications built for the Servlet 2.2 and JSP 1.1
specifications with no changes.</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Tomcat 3.x">

<p>There are several versions of <strong>Tomcat 3.x</strong> currently
available for download:</p>

<ul>
<li>Version <strong>3.3</strong> is the current production quality release for
the Servlet 2.2 and JSP 1.1 specifications.  Tomcat 3.3 is the latest
continuation of the Tomcat 3.x architecture and it is more advanced then 3.2.4,
which is the 'old' production quality release.</li>
<li>Version 3.2.4 is the 'old' production quality release and is now in
maintenance only mode.</li>
<li>Version 3.1.1 is a legacy release.</li>
</ul>

<p>
All <strong>Tomcat 3.x</strong> releases trace their heritage back to the
original Servlet and JSP implementations that Sun donated to the Apache
Software Foundation.  The 3.x versions all implement the <strong>Servlet
2.2</strong> and <strong>JSP 1.1</strong> specifications.
</p>

<p><strong>Tomcat 3.3.x</strong>. Version 3.3.1 is the current production 
quality release. It continues the refactoring that was begun in version 3.2 and
carries it to its logical conclusion.  Version 3.3 provides a much more modular
design and allows the servlet container to be customized by adding and removing
modules that control the processing of servlet requests.  This version also
contains many performance improvements.</p> 

<p><strong>Tomcat 3.2.x</strong>.  Version 3.2 added few new features 
since 3.1; the major effort was a refactoring of the internals to improve 
performance and stability.  The 3.2.1 release, like 3.1.1, was a security 
patch.  Version 3.2.2 fixed a large number of bugs and all known 
specification compliance issues.  Version 3.2.3 was a security update that 
closes a serious security hole.  Version 3.2.4 is a minor bug fix release.  
All users of Tomcat versions prior to 3.2.3 should updgrade as soon as 
possible.  With the exception of fixes for critical security related bugs, 
development on the Tomcat 3.2.x branch has stopped.</p> 

<p><strong>Tomcat 3.1.x</strong>.  The 3.1 release contained several 
improvements over Tomcat 3.0, including servlet reloading, WAR file 
support and added connectors for the IIS and Netscape web servers.  The 
latest maintenance release, 3.1.1, contained fixes for security problems.  
There is no active development ongoing for Tomcat 3.1.x.  Users of Tomcat 
3.1 should update to 3.1.1 to close the security holes and they are 
strongly encouraged to migrate to the current production release, Tomcat 
3.3.</p>
