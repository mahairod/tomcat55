This FAQ is maintained by the Tomcat Committers.
The content for this FAQ is usually discovered
by lurking in the tomcat-user list.
<br />
If you wish to make a comment about the FAQ, make the comment on the
tomcat-user list. Do not email any of the committers directly and do not
email the tomcat-dev list. (Unless other people liked your suggestion
and it was accidently missed by the committers who read the tomcat-user list)
Emailing the tomcat-user list will allow a larger audience to immediately
learn and critique your findings.

      How did Tomcat get its name?
    </a>
  </question>
  <answer>
    He (James Duncan Davidson) came up with "Tomcat" since the animal
    represented something that could take care of itself and fend for
    itself. That's how he came up with the name.
