  </question>
  <answer>
    Unlike tomcat 4.x, tomcat 5.x creates context configuration files for you
    in its conf/[Engine name]/[Host name] directory.  This is part of the change
    in tomcat's configuration mechanism from version 4.x to make overall configuration
    more robust, flexible, and enterprise-friendly.  Note, however, that this
    has changed the recommended deployment practices for web applications.

    These context configuration files are created by tomcat, but not removed
    by tomcat, because the user may have changed them or other files in the conf
    directory.  The suggested practice for tomcat 5
    is to place context configuration files in the META-INF/context.xml directory
    of your webapp, and use Tomcat's Manager webapp to deploy/undeploy your applications.
