  </question>
  <answer>
    Unlike tomcat 4.x, tomcat 5.x creates context configuration files for you
    in its conf/[Engine name]/[Host name] directory.  These files are NOT removed
    by tomcat automatically.  The suggested practice, again a change from tomcat4,
    is to place context configuration files in the META-INF/context.xml directory
    of your webapp, and use Tomcat's Manager webapp to deploy/undeploy your applications.
