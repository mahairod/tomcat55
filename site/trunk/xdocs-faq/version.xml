    <question>

    </question>
    <answer>
    It depends on the version of the
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/">Servlet API</a> you need.

    <ul>
     <li>Tomcat 3 supports the 2.2 API</li>
     <li>Tomcat 4 supports the 2.3 API</li>
     <li>Tomcat 5 supports the 2.4 API</li>
    </ul>

     As of December 3, 2003 Tomcat 5 has been declared stable.

    <br/><br/>

     There are 2 flavors of Tomcat 4: 4.0.X and 4.1.X - both of which
     are not receiving enhancments. (Excluding security issues)
     Both (4.0 and 4.1) are suitable for production.
     Version 4.1.X is significantly faster than 4.0.X.
    <br/><br/>

     Tomcat 3 I know nothing about with respect to performance and
     maintenance. AFAIK - it
     is still receiving security fixes. The
     <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">
      Tomcat home page </a> should have the correct recommendation.
