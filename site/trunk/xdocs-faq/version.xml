    </question>
    <answer>
    It depends on the version of the
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/">Servlet API</a> you need.

    <ul>
     <li>Tomcat 3 supports the 2.2 API</li>
     <li>Tomcat 4 supports the 2.3 API</li>
     <li>Tomcat 5 supports the 2.4 API</li>
    </ul>

     Tomcat 5 is alpha quality. It isn't ready for production.
    <br/><br/>

     There are 2 flavors of Tomcat 4, 4.0.X and 4.1.X. The 4.1.x version is
     still slowly receiving new enhancements but this
     trend is subsiding while more attention is made on Tomcat5.
     Version 4.0.X is only receiving security fixes. Both (4.0 and 4.1)
     are suitable for production. (YMMV).
     Version 4.1.X is significantly faster than 4.0.X.
    <br/><br/>

     Tomcat 3 I know nothing about with respect to performance and
     maintenance. AFAIK - it
     is still receiving security fixes. The
     <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">
      tomcat home page </a> should have the correct recommendation.
