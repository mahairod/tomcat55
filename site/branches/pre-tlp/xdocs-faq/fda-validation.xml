<section name="Preface">
  <p>
    This page discusses using Tomcat in an 
    <a href="http://www.fda.gov">FDA</a>
    <a href="http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/comp/guidance/938.html">
    validated</a> environment,
    i.e. one where 
    <a href="http://www.21cfrpart11.com/">
    21 CFR Part 11</a> regulations apply.
  </p>
  <p> 
    Please note that although this page mentions specific companies, we do not explicitly
    endorse or sell anyone's services.  Tomcat and Apache are not-for-profit organizations.
    This page is also far from a complete listing of vendors and support options.  It is
    meant as a demonstration showing that these options do exist and 
    that running Tomcat in a validated environment is both feasible and reasonable.

  <question>
    <a name="canItBeDone">
      Can Tomcat be used in a validated environment?
    </a>
  </question>
  <answer>
    <p>
    Yes.  There's nothing in Tomcat's design or implementation that prevent it
    from being used in a validated environment.  The same validation procedures
    and guidelines that apply to most software packages apply to Tomcat as well.
    Being an open-source application does not preclude Tomcat validation.  In fact,
    it helps in at least one key aspect: the source code itself can be audited, as
    can the commit and change logs for the software.

  <question>
    <a name="hasAnyoneDoneIt">
      Has anyone actually done it?
    </a>
  </question>
  <answer>
    <p>
    Yes.  As shown in this user mailing list
    <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=tomcat-user&amp;m=109836874319797&amp;w=2">archive</a>,
    Merck and other large companies are using Tomcat in a validated environment.  In addition,
    there is at least one application provider
    (<a href="http://www.interchangedigital.com">Interchange Digital</a>)
    whose application runs on Tomcat that has deployed said package in numerous pharma data
    centers.
    </p>
  </answer>

  <question>
    <a name="isTomcatItselfValidated">
      Is Tomcat itself validated?
    </a>
  </question>
  <answer>
    <p>
    Yes.  Tomcat itself is validated to the extent it can be.  Tomcat implements two
    Java Specifications: the 
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet">Servlet Specification</a>
    and the
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp">Java Server Pages (JSP) Specification</a>.
    Each of these specifications has a Technology Compatbility Kit (TCK), which is a collection
    of tests to certify a given product meets the Specification fully and accurately.
    </p>
    <p>
    The <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache Software Foundation</a> is licensed to run
    these TCKs.  They are run against every single Tomcat release.  <strong>No Tomcat release is
    pronounced stable unless it has passed both of these TCKs with 100% compliance.</strong>
    Therefore, every stable Tomcat release is validated to the extent of Tomcat's core functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
    Furthermore, any company of individual may 
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/scholarship/">apply</a> to obtains and use these
    TCKs themselves.  That way, you can re-validated Tomcat including any custom patches
    you have implemented.
    </p>
    <p>
    However, we cannot validate your application's use of Tomcat.  You're on your own there.

  <question>
    <a name="supportAroundValidation">
      What kind of support is there around validating Tomcat?
    </a>
  </question>
  <answer>
    <p>
    Several kinds.  They include:
    <ul>
      <li>There are numerous <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/vendors.html">smaller vendors</a>
          and several large ones, including IBM, HP, Sun, and Novell, who offer Tomcat consulting and support
          services, including application auditing, environment assessments, and risk analysis.</li>
      <li>There are numerous vendors in addition to the above consultants, 
          like 
          <a href="http://www.covalent.net/">Covalent</a> and 
          <a href="http://www.jboss.org/services/prodsupport">JBoss</a>, 
          who offer 24/7/365 enterprise-level support for Tomcat.</li>
      <li>The Tomcat <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/mail2.html#Tomcat">mailing lists</a> are
          extremely active and contain members of many of the above organizations, including contractors
          available for hire.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  </answer>

  <question>
    <a name="signedReleases">
      How do I know I have a validated release?  How do I know no one
      has tampered with the release package?
    </a>
  </question>
  <answer>
    <p>
      All Tomcat releases are signed using the Release Manager's
      <a href="http://www.pgpi.org/doc/pgpintro">PGP</a> key.  The key
      is also available in the <i>KEYS</i> file that ships with every
      Tomcat release.  The same <i>KEYS</i> file is also available in the
      Tomcat CVS repository 
      (<a href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/jakarta-tomcat-5/KEYS">here</a>).
      The PGP signatures are available on all the Tomcat download pages, 
      and can (and should!) be used to verify the release really is the
      signed distribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for tampering: every Tomcat release is also digested using the MD5
      algorithm as specified in 
      <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1321.html">RFC1321</a>.  The MD5
      digest is included in all the download pages.  Users run MD5 on their
      local machine to verify that the digest of what they downlaoded is the
      same as that published in the Apache download pages.  That way, users
      are assured the distribution has not been modified since the Release Manager
      signed it.

  <question>
    <a name="security"> 
      What about security?  I'm concerned about attacks.
    </a>
  </question>
  <answer>
    <p>
      There's no need to be.  See the <a href="security.html">security page</a> of
      this FAQ for more information.
