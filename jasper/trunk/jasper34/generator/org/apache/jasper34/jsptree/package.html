<h2>Tree representation of a JSP page</h2>

<h2>History</h2>

jasper33 and 40 creates a tree of Generators, and then it traverses the
tree for each stage to generate the code for a specific hook.

<p>
This code represents the information that was stored in the generators,
in order to allow a Visitor pattern to be used and decouple the actual
code generator from the representation of the source tree.

<p>
It will also be used ( via Facade pattern ) to plug other code generator
models for advanced processings and optimizations.
