<h2>Tree representation of a JSP page</h2>

JspPageInfo is the main class, collecting all the informations about a page.
It contains a tree of JspNode ( TODO - right now it's a tree of Generators).
It also contains informations about all the tag libs and all the tags.

<h2>Tags</h2>

Tags are special because they affect the way the source is parsed. This is 
a very tricky thing, and the reason the parser needs to depend on the 
jsptree and implement/use the directive processing.

<p>

We keep all the informations available in TagLibraries, which collects 
all the taglibs for a webapps ( TODO: make sure it's singeleton/webapp ).
This avoids re-reading the tlds and allows the container to push 
the information into jasper ( if it has it already - like from parsing
web.xml or preprocessing at deployment time ). The liaison also makes callbacks
to the container, which could implement a more efficient reading or use
the default ( which now is quite bad - DOM and quite complex )

<h2>History</h2>

jasper33 and 40 creates a tree of Generators, and then it traverses the
tree for each stage to generate the code for a specific hook.

<p>
This code represents the information that was stored in the generators,
in order to allow a Visitor pattern to be used and decouple the actual
code generator from the representation of the source tree.

<p>
It will also be used ( via Facade pattern ) to plug other code generator
models for advanced processings and optimizations.
