General purpose implementations of jasper interfaces. You can choose 
one of those or use a container specific interface.
<p>
The idea is to get maximum flexibility: jasper can run as a simple
servlet, without asking for anything ( almost ) from the servlet
container, or it can take advantage of various container features
and integrate closely to get maximum performance.
