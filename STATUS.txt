  kkolinko: This patch is a backport of rev.697046
    A comment in STATUS.txt there ([1]) says
    "use trunk >=r690600 of TC-native", thus it requires
    TC-native 1.1.15 or .16.
    Do we need to update REQUIRED_PATCH, RECOMMENDED_PV
    in AprLifecycleListener?
    [1] http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/tomcat/tc6.0.x/trunk/STATUS.txt?r1=697046&r2=697045&pathrev=697046
  markt: We should update recommended.

  Reuses StringBuffer, uses char instead of single-char String, etc.

  Fix compilation error with some nested tag files and simple tags
  This is Konstantin's original patch
  Concerns were raised regarding possible regressions. I have tested tag files,
  simple tags and tags and can't find any regression issues. The TCK also
  passes.

* Port r795052 from modules/ha to modules/cluster
  Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=40551
  Enable the JvmRouteBinderValve to work with PersistentManagers as well as clusters
  Patch by Chris Chandler
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=795052&view=rev
  This has already been applied to OACC: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=812446&view=rev

* Spurious startup errors in the cluster
  Although the secondary node is able to retrieve all sessions,
  the main thread doesn't see the changed stateTransfered flag,
  and thus waits until the transfer timeout occurs.
  Observed on Solaris. Switching to volatile fixes it.
  Backport from trunk: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=814024&view=rev
  Need to patch both copies of DeltaManager (ha and cluster).
  +1: rjung, markt, mturk
  -1:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=46384
  Correct synchronisation problem that leads to cluster members permanently
  disappearing
  https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=24253
  +1: markt, rjung, kkolinko
  -1:
  rjung: the same fix seems to be necessary for
  container/modules/groupcom/src/share/org/apache/catalina/tribes/membership/McastServiceImpl.java
  (plus another use of the mutex also in receive() around membership.removeMember(m).

  kkolinko: re rjung's comment: Those /tribes/membership/ classes
  are not included in TC 5.5 releases. Thus no need to patch them.
  I wonder if those can be removed from /tc5.5.x/trunk, but I actually do
  not mind.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=46950
  Adds support for SSL renegotiation when CLIENT-CERT auth is required due to a
  security constraint
  Note: Patch cannot be applied until tc-native 1.1.17 has been released
        since it depends on a new native method

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47878
  Return 404's rather than a permanent 500 if a JSP is deleted
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=439565
  +1: markt
  -1:

* Fix cluster replication problem for o.a.c.ha: session expiration
  uses a replication shortcut, so that attributes changed immediately
  before invalidation do not get replicated before the expiration
  replication message. That's a problem in case a session listener
  needs the changed attribute.
  Has already been fixed in trunk, OACC and tc5.5.x (only in o.a.c.cluster).

* Fix CVE-2009-3548 - Windows installer uses insecure default password
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=834047&view=rev
  +1: markt, mturk
  -1:
   kkolinko: It cannot be applied cleanly, because manager and
   host-manager are at different paths in TC5.5.

  Alternative patch:
  Fix CVE-2009-3548 - Windows installer uses insecure default password
  Also removes some old commented-out code and changes some message strings.
