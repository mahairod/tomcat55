                         Apache Tomcat 5.5 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=38743
  Warn if the user tries to set an invalid property.
  Port of http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=565464
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2009-07-02-bug38743.patch
  +1: markt
   0: fhanik - big step for an old branch, could be risky, I'd wait until after next release if we consider it
  -1:

* Minor cleanups for AccessLogValve classes
  Reuses StringBuffer, uses char instead of single-char String, etc.
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2009-07-15_tc55_ALV.patch
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2009-07-15_tc55_FCALV.patch
  +1: kkolinko
  -1:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=42390
  Fix compilation error with some nested tag files and simple tags
  This is Konstantin's original patch
  Concerns were raised regarding possible regressions. I have tested tag files,
  simple tags and tags and can't find any regression issues. The TCK also
  passes.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=804734&view=rev
  +1: markt, kkolinko
  -1:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44041
  Threading issue in class loading (using Filip's suggestion)
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2009-11-18-bug44041.patch
  +1: markt, kkolinko
  -1:
   kkolinko: To reviewers: the patch looks scary, but the only thing it
   actually does is to add "synchronized (name.intern()) {" around the
   whole contents of the method.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47878
  Return 404's rather than a permanent 500 if a JSP is deleted
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=439565
  +1: markt
  -1:
   0: kkolinko (
     - In general looks good, but I do not like Compiler.java part of the
     patch. Printing exceptions to stderr aka catalina.out is not good, but
     silently swallowing them is not good either. Though that is to be
     fixed in tc6.0.x first.
     - I would like rev.832102 to be combined with this one.
     - Just a note: This issue won't affect configurations where Jasper
     runs with development=false.
  )


* Fix CVE-2009-3548 - Windows installer uses insecure default password
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=834047&view=rev
  +1: markt, mturk
  -1:
   kkolinko: It cannot be applied cleanly, because manager and
   host-manager are at different paths in TC5.5.

  Alternative patch:
  Fix CVE-2009-3548 - Windows installer uses insecure default password
  Also removes some old commented-out code and changes some message strings.
  This patch file is a backport of revs. 834047, 836036, 836045, 836209
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2009-11-14_Installer_password_tc55.patch

  -1:

* Single quote should be not be treated as a separator
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=830999&view=rev
  +1: markt, kkolinko
  -1: 

* Provide new option to allow = in cookie values
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2009-11-17-cookie-allow-equals.patch
  +1: markt, kkolinko
  -1: 

* Alternative fix for CVE-2009-3555 SSL MITN
  The current patch uses an async callback to close the socket. It is
  technically possible an attack may succeed before the socket is closed
  The new patch only logs failed server initiated negotiations.
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2009-11-20-cve2009-3555-v2.patch

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47609
  Implement fail-safe EOL conversion for source distributions
  Based on a patch provided by sebb
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2009-12-31-bug47609.patch
  +1: markt
  -1: kkolinko: 1) extra comma in "*.java" pattern, 2) missing
   extentionless names, 3) native sources are no more included, so *.c etc.
   patterns are not needed.

  Corrected patch:
  I should add that this patch is required, because otherwise the *.keystore
  files used in storeconfig[-ha] module tests become broken in the -src.tar.gz
  bundle.

  Only the APR lifecycle listener should try and initialise APR
  Patch also syncs all APR lifecycle listener changes from 6.0.x to 5.5.x
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2009-11-27-bug48300-tc5.patch
  +1: markt, rjung, kkolinko
  -1: 
    kkolinko: 1. It introduces SSLEngine property in AprLifecycleListener,
     it could be described in ssl-howto.html, see 6.0.  2. BZ 48613 is
     an issue that existed before this patch, but it makes it noticeable.

* Address https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45255
  Prevent session fixation by changing session ID on authentication by default
  If you don't like the session ID changing by default, feel free to caveat your
  vote. If there is sufficient support for the patch but insufficient support
  for changing the ID by default I'll apply the patch with the default set to
  not change the session ID
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=889716&view=rev
  +1: markt, rjung
  +1: kkolinko: with r892415
  -1: 
  rjung: I'd prefer off by default, because 5.5 is assumed to be very stable,
  and changing by default can break things like e.g. existing profiles for
  automated stress testing.
  kkolinko: I agree to have off by default

  Provide setter for the new AuthenticatorBase property

  Prevent use of non-RFC2616 compliant custom status messages
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=892612&view=rev
  +1: markt
  +1: kkolinko:  +1 to use r892777 instead of proposed r892612
     - TC 6.0 version of the patch is more applicable here, than the one of
     trunk.
  -1:

  No update on the required version (17)

  We should not vote before 1.1.19 is officially released.
