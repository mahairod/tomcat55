                         Apache Tomcat 5.5 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=51042
  Don't notify session creation listeners when changing session ID on
  authentication

* Multiple improvements to the Windows Installer
  - https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=33262
    Install monitor to auto-start for current user only rather than all users to
    be consistent with menu item creation.
  - Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=40510
    Provide an option to install shortcuts for the current user or all users.
    Also ensure registry is correctly cleaned on uninstall for 64-bit platforms.
  - Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=50949
    Provide the ability to specify the AJP port and service name when installing
    Tomcat using the Windows installer. This permits multiple instances of the
    same Tomcat version to be installed side-by-side.
  - Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=51135
    Fix auto-detection of JAVA_HOME for 64-bit Windows platforms that only have
    a 32-bit JVM installed.

  -0: kkolinko: I think that allowing to configure service name is too much of a change
       to be backported to 5.5
       (it changes registry layout, http://tomcat.markmail.org/thread/a65tumeeo2yutxuw 
       as well as menu names etc.)
       I think there is not much demand for this feature in 5.5 to justify this.
       The rest of changes and fixes are OK to backport (e.g. allow to specify port numbers).
      markt: I'm aware of some Tomcat 5 users via $work that would like to be
             able to install multiple versions in parallel
             Also, it is easier to keep the installers completely in sync. 
      kkolinko: OK, let's go on then.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=51550
  Display error page rather than an empty response for an IllegalStateException
  https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=27317

  -0: kkolinko: I do not like removing the catch from CoyoteAdapter. It
      looks safer the old way. JkCoyoteHandler does not handle Errors, just
      Exceptions. It seems from the patch that all you need to fix this bug is
        ep.setStatus(MsgContext.JK_STATUS_ERROR);
      Can't it be done by CoyoteAdapter itself?
  -0: schultz: I tend to agree with Konstantin's assertion that the catch
      block is important. I understand the change to the status, but could
      you explain why the catch(Throwable) block has been removed?
