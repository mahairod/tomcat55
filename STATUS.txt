PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK/OTHER:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Update Eclipse compiler and switch to using ecj.jar
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2011-08-25-lib-update-tc5-v2.patch

        + update build/resources/License.rtf to match LICENSE file
        + in class-loader-howto.xml sort the JARs list alphabetically
        I've run jarcheck tool against the archive. Results are in
         http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/jarcheck/
        Most classes are JDK 1.2 compatible. Some are JDK 1.6 (esp. annotations processor),
        but it is the same in ecj 3.3.1 that is currently used.
        Those classes are absent in jasper-compiler-jdt.jar that we would
        generate, so their presence does not matter.
  +1: rjung:
        I suggest we switch after releasing 5.5.34 so that the change isn't introduced
        immediately before tagging.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52059
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1186763&view=rev
  Fix a typo in Windows uninstaller:
  Do not forget to remove Tomcat keys from 32-bit registry on deinstallation.

* Make configuration issue for RemoteAddrValve, RemoteHostValve result
  in the failure of the valve rather than just a warning message.
  Ensure changes to the configuration of the RemoteHostValve and the
  RemoteIpValve via JMX are thread-safe.
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2011-10-26_tc55_RequestFilterValve_v3.patch
  It is based on the valves part of r1189256 and r1187027. (r1189258, r1187029 in TC7)
  +1: kkolinko (see note below)

  kkolinko: It does its work and prevents app from starting and working. Though
    1. Autodeployment prints the same error every 10s. It is OK, though a
       bit annoying.
    2. Application that failed to start responds with 403. I do not
       understand why. I would expect 404 or 503.
    3. Application that failed to start is not listed by the manager app.
       It is expected, but does not explain why error 403 and not 404 is observed.

* Improve performance of parameter processing
