  kkolinko: This patch is a backport of rev.697046
    A comment in STATUS.txt there ([1]) says
    "use trunk >=r690600 of TC-native", thus it requires
    TC-native 1.1.15 or .16.
    Do we need to update REQUIRED_PATCH, RECOMMENDED_PV
    in AprLifecycleListener?
    [1] http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/tomcat/tc6.0.x/trunk/STATUS.txt?r1=697046&r2=697045&pathrev=697046
  markt: We should update recommended.

* Minor cleanups for AccessLogValve classes
  Reuses StringBuffer, uses char instead of single-char String, etc.

* Improve build.properties comment in ant build files.
  Backport from trunk, only the part on build.xml.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=797425&view=rev
  +1: rjung, kkolinko
  -1:
  kkolinko: (
    1. Comments are documentation, thus CTR is fine for them.
    2. The phrase "See "build.properties.default" in the top level directory"
    is a bit wrong here: here it is in the build directory, not in the top
    level one.

    3. There are two other files besides build/build.xml in 5.5:
     a) build/resources/build.xml that is copied
     the top level directory of sources archive at build time. See *-src.zip
     file from a release.
     b) webapps/docs/build.xml It is mentioned in the docs (in building.html).
  )

* Fix a couple of Java 1.5 uses that should be 1.4 compatible
