PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=38743
  Warn if the user tries to set an invalid property.
  Port of http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=565464
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2009-07-02-bug38743.patch
  +1: markt
   0: fhanik - big step for an old branch, could be risky, I'd wait until after next release if we consider it
  -1: kkolinko: It is reported that the change to the return type of the setProperty
    method in o.a.t.util.IntrospectionUtils breaks binary compatibility:
    http://marc.info/?l=tomcat-user&m=127083540720353&w=2

* Minor cleanups for AccessLogValve classes
  Reuses StringBuffer, uses char instead of single-char String, etc.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47878
  Return 404's rather than a permanent 500 if a JSP is deleted
  Make sure first response post deletion is correct
  Port of r439565, r832102 & r904834

  -1: kkolinko: (I think the patch to JspServletWrapper#service() method is wrong.

     One thing that surely is wrong there: when FileNotFoundException is caught after
     compile() we may respond with response.sendError(SC_NOT_FOUND).
     This sendError() call should be followed by return, but instead we
     fall down to execute theServlet.service() method.
     Actually that sendError() is not needed, as we can just rethrow the FNFE:
     our caller - JspServlet#serviceJspFile() - will catch it and report.

     I propose a corrected patch below. I replaced the proposed changes to
     JspServletWrapper#service() with the current code from 6.0.x.
     )

  Corrected patch based on Mark's one:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48179
  Improve processing of TLD cache file
  https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=24918

* Remove JSSE13Factory, JSSE13SocketFactory classes,
  because
    - TC 5.5 runs on JRE 1.4+ and that comes bundled with JSSE 1.4,
      so these classes are no more needed.
    - JSSE13SocketFactory directly references com.sun.net.* classes in its
      source code without using reflection, and that causes compilation failure
      with my IDE/JRE settings.
  1)
    svn delete connectors/util/java/org/apache/tomcat/util/net/jsse/JSSE13Factory.java
    svn delete connectors/util/java/org/apache/tomcat/util/net/jsse/JSSE13SocketFactory.java

  When a node joins a cluster and it receives all the current sessions, ensure
  the sessionCreated event is fired if the Manager is configured to replicate
  session events
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=928482&view=rev
  (apply to both cluster implementations)

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48840
  If CDPATH is set, cd may result in output to stdout.
  Swallow the output. This is safe since the script outputs the value used for
  CATALINA_HOME so any issues will be visible then.
  Patch provided by mdietze

   0: kkolinko: When CDPATH is set, it creates an ambiguity in behaviour of
      "cd". That is why there is output there.
      By the way, the patch that you are proposing is probably the following
      (there is no link above):
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=928732&view=rev
  -1: 

* Fix possible overflows when calculating session statistics
  Fixes a) miscalculating the "average" because of multiplication overflow,
  b) ArithmeticException division by zero when numExpired overflows.
  The fix for trunk is already provided by r934337.

     o.a.c.ha.session and o.a.c.cluster.session packages)
