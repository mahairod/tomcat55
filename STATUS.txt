        + update build/resources/License.rtf to match LICENSE file
        + in class-loader-howto.xml sort the JARs list alphabetically
        I've run jarcheck tool against the archive. Results are in
         http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/jarcheck/
        Most classes are JDK 1.2 compatible. Some are JDK 1.6 (esp. annotations processor),
        but it is the same in ecj 3.3.1 that is currently used.
        Those classes are absent in jasper-compiler-jdt.jar that we would
        generate, so their presence does not matter.
  +1: rjung:
        I suggest we switch after releasing 5.5.34 so that the change isn't introduced
        immediately before tagging.
