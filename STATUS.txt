* Make configuration issue for RemoteAddrValve, RemoteHostValve result
  in the failure of the valve rather than just a warning message.
  Ensure changes to the configuration of these valves via JMX are thread-safe.
  Refactor value matching logic into separate method.
  Expose the new method isAllowed and isAllowValid, isDenyValid properties through JMX.
  It is based on r1189256 and r1187027, r1198622
  (r1189258, r1187029, r1198623 in TC7)

  kkolinko: It does its work and prevents app from starting and working. Though
    1. Autodeployment prints the same error every 10s. It is OK, though a
       bit annoying.
    2. Application that failed to start responds with 403. I do not
       understand why. I would expect 404 or 503.
    3. Application that failed to start is not listed by the manager app.
       It is expected, but does not explain why error 403 and not 404 is observed.

* Improve performance of parameter processing
