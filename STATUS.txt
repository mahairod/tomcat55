                         Apache Tomcat 5.5 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Remove JSSE13Factory, JSSE13SocketFactory classes,
  because
    - TC 5.5 runs on JRE 1.4+ and that comes bundled with JSSE 1.4,
      so these classes are no more needed.
    - JSSE13SocketFactory directly references com.sun.net.* classes in its
      source code without using reflection, and that causes compilation failure
      with my IDE/JRE settings.
  1)
    svn delete connectors/util/java/org/apache/tomcat/util/net/jsse/JSSE13Factory.java
    svn delete connectors/util/java/org/apache/tomcat/util/net/jsse/JSSE13SocketFactory.java
  2)

* Clean up svn:executable property (svn property cleanup didn't pass the C-T-R discussion)

  a) Remove from Java source files and from docs files
  svn propdel svn:executable container/catalina/src/share/org/apache/catalina/valves/ExtendedAccessLogValve.java
  svn propdel svn:executable jasper/src/share/org/apache/jasper/xmlparser/ParserUtils.java
  svn propdel svn:executable container/webapps/docs/default-servlet.xml
  svn propdel svn:executable container/webapps/docs/balancer-howto.xml
  svn propdel svn:executable container/webapps/jmxremote/WEB-INF/web.xml

  b) Add to .bat and .sh files where missing (most already have the property set)
  svn propset svn:executable '*' build/tag.bat
  svn propset svn:executable '*' build/tag.sh
  svn propset svn:executable '*' build/sign.bat
  svn propset svn:executable '*' build/sign.sh
  svn propset svn:executable '*' jasper/src/bin/jspc.sh
  svn propset svn:executable '*' jasper/src/bin/jspc-using-launcher.sh
  svn propset svn:executable '*' jasper/src/bin/jasper.sh
  svn propset svn:executable '*' connectors/http11/src/test/test.bat
