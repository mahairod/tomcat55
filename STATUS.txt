                         Apache Tomcat 5.5 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Minor cleanups for AccessLogValve classes
  Reuses StringBuffer, uses char instead of single-char String, etc.

* Remove JSSE13Factory, JSSE13SocketFactory classes,
  because
    - TC 5.5 runs on JRE 1.4+ and that comes bundled with JSSE 1.4,
      so these classes are no more needed.
    - JSSE13SocketFactory directly references com.sun.net.* classes in its
      source code without using reflection, and that causes compilation failure
      with my IDE/JRE settings.
  1)
