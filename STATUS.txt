                         Apache Tomcat 5.5 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Multiple improvements to the Windows Installer
  - https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=33262
    Install monitor to auto-start for current user only rather than all users to
    be consistent with menu item creation.
  - Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=40510
    Provide an option to install shortcuts for the current user or all users.
    Also ensure registry is correctly cleaned on uninstall for 64-bit platforms.
  - Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=50949
    Provide the ability to specify the AJP port and service name when installing
    Tomcat using the Windows installer. This permits multiple instances of the
    same Tomcat version to be installed side-by-side.
  - Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=51135
    Fix auto-detection of JAVA_HOME for 64-bit Windows platforms that only have
    a 32-bit JVM installed.

       1) Minor glitch in TEXT_JVM_LABEL1 message: s/Java SE 1.4/Java SE 5.0/
       like it was before, because this installer does not install "compatibility"
       package that allows to run on 1.4 JVM and thus 5.0 is required.
       2) The following was removed:
          LangString DESC_SecWebapps ${LANG_ENGLISH} "Installs other utility web applications (WebDAV, balancer, etc)."
       as well as the SecWebapps section.
       3) The following line:
          SetOutPath $INSTDIR\lib
       is for TC6+. The code for 5.5 in that place was different.
       4) In Function un.onInit:
          ${GetOPtions} $R0 "-ServiceName=" $R1
       s/OPtions/Options/
       We have the same in TC6. Apparently NSIS is case-insensitive here.

  The above patch is for build/tomcat.nsi
  The following svn commands remove unneeded files:
    svn rm build/resources/confinstall/server_1.xml
    svn rm build/resources/confinstall/server_2.xml
    svn rm build/resources/tickno.bmp
    svn rm build/resources/tickyes.bmp
    svn rm build/resources/main.ico
    svn rm build/resources/uninst.ico

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=51550
  Display error page rather than an empty response for an IllegalStateException

  -0: kkolinko: I do not like removing the catch from CoyoteAdapter. It
      looks safer the old way. JkCoyoteHandler does not handle Errors, just
      Exceptions. It seems from the patch that all you need to fix this bug is
        ep.setStatus(MsgContext.JK_STATUS_ERROR);
      Can't it be done by CoyoteAdapter itself?
  -0: schultz: I tend to agree with Konstantin's assertion that the catch
      block is important. I understand the change to the status, but could
      you explain why the catch(Throwable) block has been removed?
