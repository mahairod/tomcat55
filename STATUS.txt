                         Apache Tomcat 5.5 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]


* Remove JSSE13Factory, JSSE13SocketFactory classes,
  because
    - TC 5.5 runs on JRE 1.4+ and that comes bundled with JSSE 1.4,
      so these classes are no more needed.
    - JSSE13SocketFactory directly references com.sun.net.* classes in its
      source code without using reflection, and that causes compilation failure
      with my IDE/JRE settings.
  1)
    svn delete connectors/util/java/org/apache/tomcat/util/net/jsse/JSSE13Factory.java
    svn delete connectors/util/java/org/apache/tomcat/util/net/jsse/JSSE13SocketFactory.java

* Backport Windows installer improvements from Tomcat 7.0.5.

  See TC 6 proposal for details (r1035106).
  TC5.5 proposal is different in the following:
   - Patch includes changes to build.xml, to implement filtering for @YEAR@
   - Patch includes changes to tomcat-users_1.xml, to implement TC6/TC7
   installer feature that the character encoding that was used to write
   tomcat-users.xml is included in the XML signature that is printed
   at the top of the file. That was to support non-latin usernames.
   - TC5.5 uses the old roles "manager" and "admin", instead of the newer
   "-gui" ones.

  1. Run the following SVN commands:
   svn del build/resources/jvm.ini
   svn del build/resources/config.ini
   svn del build/resources/main.ico
   svn del build/resources/uninst.ico
   # copy icons from TC7, see r999976
   svn copy ../../trunk/res/main.ico build/resources/
   svn copy ../../trunk/res/uninst.ico build/resources/
  2. Apply patch:

  (
   For reference: here is the diff of tomcat.nsi of trunk @1035132 if I copy
   this patched tc5.5 version on top of it:
