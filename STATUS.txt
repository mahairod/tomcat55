PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK/OTHER:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52579
  Propose new implementation of ByteChunk.toStringInternal().
  This fix does not reintroduce issue BZ51400.
  This fix avoids http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6196991.
  https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=28274 (remove generics )

* Implement maxHeaderCount attribute on HTTP Connectors.
  It is equivalent of LimitRequestFields directive of Apache HTTPD
  See r1356239 in Tomcat 6.

  Notes:
  1. Implemented for HTTP protocol only. (MimeHeaders.setLimit() is called
  by HTTP protocol processors only).

  I suppose that users of AJP can leverage the LimitRequestFields directive
  in Apache HTTPD server.

  2. The feature is manageable through JMX on the ProtocolHandler MBean.

  Unlike later Tomcat versions, I did not add setter/getter methods to
  Connector class and did not expose the property on Connector MBean.

  Note that Catalina MBeans are not visible in Tomcat 5.5 by default.
  See r1356696 for instructions.

  3. To test the feature one can use
    http://localhost:8080/servlets-examples/servlet/RequestHeaderExample

  Refreshing the page in Firefox changes the number of headers in incoming request
  (adds 'cache-control' for "F5" refresh, adds 'pragma=no-cache' for "Ctrl+F5" refresh).

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53531
  ExpandWar.expand does not check the return value of File.mkdirs.
  Provide better message when a war file cannot be unpacked due to failure
  to create a directory. Fix missing message argument in ContextConfig.init().
