                         Apache Tomcat 5.5 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Add Null check when CHANGE_SESSION_ID message received.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=982877&view=rev
  +1: kfujino, markt, rjung, kkolinko, jim
  -1: 

* Fix files missing from src bundles,
  (as was mentioned in 5.5.30 Vote thread, http://markmail.org/message/q2qk4nhzh67ggzk7)
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2010-08-30_tc55_fixSkippedFiles.patch
  +1: kkolinko, rjung, jim
  -1:

* Remove JSSE13Factory, JSSE13SocketFactory classes,
  because
    - TC 5.5 runs on JRE 1.4+ and that comes bundled with JSSE 1.4,
      so these classes are no more needed.
    - JSSE13SocketFactory directly references com.sun.net.* classes in its
      source code without using reflection, and that causes compilation failure
      with my IDE/JRE settings.
  1)
    svn delete connectors/util/java/org/apache/tomcat/util/net/jsse/JSSE13Factory.java
    svn delete connectors/util/java/org/apache/tomcat/util/net/jsse/JSSE13SocketFactory.java
  2)

* Configure Tomcat to use HttpOnly for session cookies by default
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2010-04-21_tc55_context_httpOnly.patch
  +1: kkolinko
  -0: markt - Consensus was for disabled in 5.5.x
              http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=749019

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49521
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2010-07-17_tc55_bug49521.patch
  - Disable scanning for a free port in Jk AJP/1.3 connector by default.
  - Do not change maxPort field value of ChannelSocket in its #setPort()
    and #init() methods.
  - Add support for "maxPort" attribute on a <Connector> element as a synonym
    for channelSocket.maxPort

  rjung: Should we really change default behaviour for a mature version?
  kkolinko: (I think that hardly anyone uses that feature, and if it is needed,
  one can reenable it now by setting the maxPort attribute.
  It is possible to make this configurable without changing the default
  -- see attachment 25657 in BZ 49521, but I do not think that it is worth it.)
  jim: Also not comfortable with such a change this late in the game
       regarding default behavior of a stable branch.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49749
  Add httpOnly support to SSO cookie
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2010-08-25-bug49749.patch
  +1: markt, rjung
  -1:
  +1: kkolinko: Looking for usages of Constants.SINGLE_SIGN_ON_COOKIE,
     in SingleSignOn.invoke() there is one more call to response.addCookie().
     It is used to remove the cookie, so I think HttpOnly is not important there
     and thus I am letting this pass. The SingleSignOn valve is usually added to
     a <Host> (looking at the default server.xml), so we have to call
     request.getContext() to get a Context there?

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=38113
  Add system property to allow spec compliant handling of query string
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2010-08-25-bug38113.patch
  +1: markt, rjung
  -1:
  +1: kkolinko: (only with the following trivial change:
     s/Boolean.parseBoolean(..)/Boolean.valueOf(..).booleanValue()/
     because parseBoolean is @since 1.5.
     See Globals.java line 334 for an example.
  )

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49774
  Add SSL support using the APR connector to the admin app
  https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=25954
