waitForAck - should only mean, we received the message, not for the message to get processesed.
This should improve throughput, and an interceptor can do waitForCompletion

Interceptors to create
OrderInterceptor - guarantees the order of messages
WaitForCompletionInterceptor - waits for the message to get processed by all receivers before returning
FragmentationInterceptor - splits up messages that are larger than X bytes.
CoordinatorInterceptor - manages the selection of a cluster coordinator
