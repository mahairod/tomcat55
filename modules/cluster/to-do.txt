Next Steps:

- Documentation
	wrote a complete new how-to
	add example configurations
	add complete attribute descriptions
	add JMX information
	add deployment help
	Need help ( pero)
- add cluster setup template (src)	
- filter all Cluster Message 
         Filtering that no all message goes to all member.
         Setup a Valve set periodic send the cluster stage!
- build a tool that receive the stage and present it as simple web app.
    	detect some problems
    	different active sessions
    	long queues
    	detect long wait acks     
- Implement fragmentation of large replication objects
	Compress at message level 
	s. FarmDeployer war handling
- reduce memory consume
    - set new compress sender flag at default=false
    - don't copy the buffer to add message header
        transfer this from SimpleTcpCluster to DataSender pushMessage
    - make it possible that a subclass cryp the transferd messages
- add a message type to the message header.
    - filtering at receiver that drop message before build Object
- add test cluster project
    Junit test ( started)
    automated regression testing with some standard configs
- add support to dynamic property transfer from SimpleTcpCluster to the Manager
    like ReplicationTransmitter
                        	
Nice to have:
- Implement a NonSerializable interface for session attributes that do not
wish to be replicated
        Then we must have ClusterNonSerializable at common classloader
- Setup the cluster without SessionReplication Manager
         Only a Message bus.         
- Extend StandardSession if possible
- Implement primary/secondary replication logic
- Implement context attribute replication (?)
	pero:
		Also send Start/Stop messages from Context to complete cluster!
        With 5.5.10 you can wrote a Cluster Lifecycle Manager that do this.
            Register for AFTER_MANAGERREGISTER_EVENT and AFTER_MANAGERUNREGISTER_EVENT
            and also to the context ServletContextAttributeEvent Listener
            Access the Context
            	((Manager)event.getData()).getContainer()                     	
- Fix farm deployment for 5.5
   pero:
     Every start all application are deployed only to all running cluster nodes
     	New registered nodes don't get the applications!
     	Deploy must send a GET_ALL_APP to all other Deployers.
        FH: Correction, you should not send GET_ALL_APP to all deployers, only
to the main one. Which could be another property of the Member object, it
would not make sense to transfer the same webapp over and over again.
     		Only watchEnabled Deployer send this member all deployed application.
		pero:
		   Yes very true, but currently we distribute also all wars from watch node at begining.
		   Waiting to start other nodes is only change to not got these war's!
		   I have made some experiments to register war deployment at new memberAdded to cluster.	   
     Add JMX Support
     	Resend Deployed Applications to all or one cluster node.
     	Show all watch Resource
     	Processing Time
     	Change fileMessage Buffersize.
     	Start/Stop Cluster wide application
     Deployer and Watcher sync with engine background thread! 
     	Fixed!		
     Last FileMessage fragment need longe ackTimeout	
    	<Cluster ..> <Sender ... ackTimeout="60000"/> </Cluster> 	

COMPLETED
- Add a flag for replicated  attribute events, to enable or disable them 
     Now can configued with notifyListenersOnReplication=false at SimpleTCPCluster
     Also can drop HttpSessionLsitener events
         can configued with notifySessionListenersOnReplication=false at SimpleTCPCluster
- JMX friendly
    pero:  Add some MBeanSupport to SimpleTCPCluster, ReplicationTransmitter and Senders
- Refactoring DeltaManager
- Fix at 5.5.9 cluster hang bug! 
- Add more Valve to direct cluster config
- Add Lifecycle Listener support to direct cluster config
- Add ClusterListener support to direct cluster config
- Add new SocketReplicationListener
- Add Stats to DeltaManager
- Add single sign on support
- Add Keep Alive and WaitForAck at async mode implementation.
       Make this feature configurable to Sender element at server.xml
       Is include with 5.5.8
- Add support to new Async Mode from Rainer Jung
       Integrated with 5.5.9
       fastasyncqueue mode
