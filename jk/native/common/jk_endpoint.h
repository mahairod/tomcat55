 * The endpoint 'class', which represents one end of a connection to the
 * servlet engine.  Basically, supports nothing other than forwarding the
 * request to the servlet engine.  Endpoints can be persistent (as with
 * ajp13/ajp14, where a single connection is reused many times), or can last for a
 * single request (as with ajp12, where a new connection is created for
 * every request).
 *
 * An endpoint for a given protocol is obtained by the web server plugin
 * from a worker object for that protocol.  See below for details.
 *
 * As with all the core jk classes, this is essentially an abstract base
 * class which is implemented/extended by classes which are specific to a
 * particular protocol.  By using an abstract base class in this manner,
 * plugins can be written for different servers (e.g. IIS, Apache) without
 * the plugins having to worry about which protocol they are talking.
 *
 * This particular OO-in-C system uses a 'endpoint_private' pointer to
 * point to the protocol-specific data/functions.  So in the subclasses, the
 * methods do most of their work by getting their hands on the
 * endpoint_private pointer and then using that to get at the functions for
 * their protocol.
 *
 * Try imagining this as a 'public abstract class', and the
 * endpoint_private pointer as a sort of extra 'this' reference.  Or
 * imagine that you are seeing the internal vtables of your favorite OO
 * language.  Whatever works for you.
 *
 * See jk_ajp13_worker.c/jk_ajp14_worker.c and jk_ajp12_worker.c for examples.
