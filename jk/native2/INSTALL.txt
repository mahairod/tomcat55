  APACHE INSTALLATION OVERVIEW

  For complete documentation, see
  http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-4.1-doc/jk2/index.html
  
  Quick Start - Apache 2

  In the following example Apache2 is installed in 
  /usr/local/apache2 and the commands are executed in the
  jakarta-tomcat-connectors/native2 directory. 

  $ ./buildconf
  $ ./configure --with-apxs2=PREFIX/bin/apxs
  $ make
  $ make install
  $ PREFIX/bin/apachectl start

     NOTES: * Replace PREFIX with the filesystem path under which 
              Apache should be installed.  A typical installation
              might use "/usr/local/apache2" for PREFIX (without the
              quotes).
