  APACHE INSTALLATION OVERVIEW

  For complete documentation, see
  http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-4.1-doc/jk2/index.html
  
  Quick Start - Apache 2

  In the following example Apache2 is installed in 
  /usr/local/apache2 and the commands are executed in the
  jakarta-tomcat-connectors/native2 directory. 

  $ ./buildconf
  $ ./configure --with-apxs2=PREFIX/bin/apxs
  $ make
  $ make install

     NOTES: * Replace PREFIX with the filesystem path under which 
              Apache should be installed.  A typical installation
              might use "/usr/local/apache2" for PREFIX (without the
              quotes).


  Quick Start - IIS
  
  Use the provided install4iss.js script file.
  Put the isapi_redirector2.dll and install4iis.js to the path
  <where you installed tomcat>/bin .
  Copy the workers2.properties file to the path
  <where you installed tomcat>/conf .
  Now open the command prompt and cd to the tomcat bin directory.
  
  C:\Tomcat\bin> cscript install4iis.js
  
  The provided script will install the isapi filter and create the
  virtual directory named /jakarta with execute permission.

  Restart the WWW service and you are ready to use the isapi_redirector2.
