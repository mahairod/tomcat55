/** Static declarations for all 'hardcoded' modules. This is a hack, 
 *  needed to initialize the static 'type system' for jk. 
 *
 *  A better solution would use 'introspection' and dlsyms to locate the 
 *  factory, using the common naming schema. This is a bit harder to implement
 *  ( we can do it later ) and may have problems on some buggy OSs ( I assume
 *  most decent systems support .so/.dll and symbols, but you can never know )
 * 
 *  Both solutions could be used in paralel - for start we'll use this
 *  hack and static registration. Don't put anything else here, just 
 *  static declarations for the factory methods and the registrerFactory() call.
