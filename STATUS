                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* IcedTea support. Upcoming Linux distributions will package a (working) open source JRE,
  available in /usr. As a result, it could now be possible to use a "/usr/bin/java" binary
  if one is present and expect results. [tested on Fedora 8 test 3]

   Comment by rjung: Maybe switching "then" and "else" cases by using "-x" instead of "! -x".
                     This way the error exit stays the last case which seems more natural.
