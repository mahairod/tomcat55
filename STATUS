                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Make server.xml parsing warnings more generic, add support for the NIO connector
* Connector is no longer an exception case. Any new component can still use setProperty and return a boolean 
* to accept or reject the property

* IcedTea support. Upcoming Linux distributions will package a (working) open source JRE,
  available in /usr. As a result, it could now be possible to use a "/usr/bin/java" binary
  if one is present and expect results. [tested on Fedora 8 test 3]

   Comment by rjung: Maybe switching "then" and "else" cases by using "-x" instead of "! -x".
                     This way the error exit stays the last case which seems more natural.

    
* Add a working ANT script that signs and publishes JARs to a maven repo

* Final fixes to the Cookie handling. This makes sure that we unescape any value
  that has been quoted and ensures the unescaping is the exact reverse of the
  escaping. This patch also tidies up ServerCookie to make it clearer what
  applies to which particular cookie spec.
