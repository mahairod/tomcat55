                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================

* Use newer eclipse jdt - old location is gone (reported by Jason Britian via email)
  update to jdt.loc=http://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.3.1-200709211145/eclipse-JDT-3.3.1.zip
  +1: pero, funkman, remm

* Call StopAwait at StandardServer.stop as port==-1
  +1: pero
  -1: remm (would like clarification on the sleep value, currently 100s)
  -1: No link to proposed fix given.
  
* Arrange doc of connectors.
  http://people.apache.org/~jfclere/patches/tc.docs.patch
  +1: jfclere, remm
  -1:

* Make server.xml parsing warnings more generic, add support for the NIO connector

* to accept or reject the property
  http://people.apache.org/~fhanik/patches/digester-attribute-warnings.patch
  +1: fhanik
  -1: remm (removes support for the production APR connectors, no real benefit of the patch)
