                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Make server.xml parsing warnings more generic, add support for the NIO connector
* Connector is no longer an exception case. Any new component can still use setProperty and return a boolean 
* to accept or reject the property

* IcedTea support. Upcoming Linux distributions will package a (working) open source JRE,
  available in /usr. As a result, it could now be possible to use a "/usr/bin/java" binary
  if one is present and expect results. [tested on Fedora 8 test 3]
