# Note the wsFrame.* messages are used as close reasons in WebSocket control
# frames and therefore must be 123 bytes (not characters) or less in length.
# Messages are encoded using UTF-8 where a single character may be encoded in
# as many as 4 bytes.
wsFrame.byteToLongFail=Too many bytes ([{0}]) were provided to be converted into a long
wsFrame.controlFragmented=A fragmented control frame was received but control frames may not be fragmented
wsFrame.controlPayloadTooBig=A control frame was sent with a payload of size [{0}] which is larger than the maximum permitted of 125 bytes
wsFrame.controlNoFin=A control frame was sent that did not have the fin bit set. Control frames are not permitted to use continuation frames.
wsFrame.invalidOpCode= A WebSocket frame was sent with an unrecognised opCode of [{0}]
wsFrame.invalidUtf8=A WebSocket text frame was received that could not be decoded to UTF-8 because it contained invalid byte sequences
wsFrame.invalidUtf8Close=A WebSocket close frame was received with a close reason that contained invalid UTF-8 byte sequences
wsFrame.noContinuation=A new message was started when a continuation frame was expected
wsFrame.notMasked=The client frame was not masked but all client frames must be masked
wsFrame.oneByteCloseCode=The client sent a close frame with a single byte payload which is not valid
wsFrame.textMessageTooBig=The decoded text message was too big for the output buffer and the endpoint does not support partial messages
wsFrame.wrongRsv=The client frame set the reserved bits to [{0}] which was not supported by this endpoint
