<H3>Apache Tomcat @VERSION@</H3>
<p></p>
<p>This version of Tomcat can use the AJP 1.3 protocol or JNI to connect to 
native webservers. Among the native connectors available from the Jakarta 
Tomcat Connectors subproject, using the JK 2 native connector 
is recommended. Binaries can be downloaded 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-tomcat-connectors/jk2/release">here</a>.</p>
<p><b>NOTE: The tar files in this distribution use GNU tar extensions, 
and must be untarred with a GNU compatible version of tar. The version 
of <CODE>tar</CODE> on Solaris and Mac OS X will not work with 
these files.</b></P>
<p><b>NOTE: Due to new licensing guidelines mandated by the Apache Software
Foundation Board of Directors, a JMX implementation can no longer
be distributed with the Apache Tomcat binaries. As a result, you
must download a JMX 1.2 implementation (such as the Sun Reference
Implementation) and copy the JAR containing the API and
implementation of the JMX specification to: ${catalina.home}/bin/jmx.jar<br>
For similar reasons, a Windows installer for Tomcat is no longer available.
