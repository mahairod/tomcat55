PROJECT jakarta-check SOURCE TREE 
=================================

This is the source code tree for jakarta-check(Jcheck) which is a
set of API validation tests for the Servlet 2.2 APIs and the JSP 
1.1 APIs.

How to Build
------------

There are 2 compilation scripts provided, a ksh based script for
Unix and a .bat based DOS build script. Essentially these scripts are
wrappers that put the ant.jar file on the classpath and calls:

        java org.apache.tools.ant.Main

To build, execute the either of the following commands in this
directory:

        (unix)% compile 
        (dos)> compile.bat 

This will build tests into a build directory located in this directory.

Windows Note: If you get an "Out of Environment Space" message, you
need to clean-up the initial environment of your command prompt window.

To build a 'distribution' build (without the tests, and with all the
classes jarrd up nice) execute:

        (unix)% compile dist
        (dos)> compile.bat dist

To clean out the build (removes the build dir):

        (unix)% compile clean
        (dos)> compile.bat clean

NOTE: To build Jcheck you will need "servlet-2.2.0.jar" in your CLASSPATH.
      It has all the Servlet 2.2 and JSP 1.1 public APIs. It can be found
      in the jakarta-tools workspace.
      Ofcourse, you will need a correct version of JDK (and tools.jar
      for JDK 1.2) as well.

Running the Build
-----------------

Tests can be run in two different ways:

1) Running tests against the tomcat server:

   The scripts will automatically start the tomcat webserver and run tests
   against this server. Once the tests are executed, server will be shut
   down automatically by the script. You will need the following classes in
   your CLASSPATH:

	- JDK classes (and tools.jar for JDK 1.2)
	- servlet.jar (Servlet 2.2 and JSP 1.1 public APIs)
	- webserver.jar (tomcat servlet container)
	- jasper.jar (JSP engine)

	(The last three jars can be obtained from the jakarta-tomcat
	 wrokspace by doing a distribution build).
	
   - Running Servlet tests

        (unix)% compile
        (unix)% cd build
        (unix)% runTest servlet

        (dos)> compile
        (dos)> cd build
        (dos)> runTest.bat servlet

   - Running JSP tests

        (unix)% compile
        (unix)% cd build
        (unix)% runTest jsp

        (dos)> compile
        (dos)> cd build
        (dos)> runTest.bat jsp

2) Running test against other servers:

   - Running Servlet tests.

	The server-side web-application is in build/servlet-tests.war 
     file. Install this war file on the server you want to test. Then 

        (unix)% compile
        (unix)% cd build
        (unix)% runClient servlet {host} {port}

        (dos)> compile
        (dos)> cd build
        (dos)> runClient.bat servlet {host} {port}

   - Running JSP tests.

	The server-side web-application is in build/jsp-tests.war 
     file. Install this war file on the server you want to test. Then 

        (unix)% compile
        (unix)% cd build
        (unix)% runClient jsp {host} {port}

        (dos)> compile
        (dos)> cd build
        (dos)> runSClient.bat jsp {host} {port}


BEFORE COMMITTING CHANGES
-------------------------

You must, MUST do a `compile clean;compile` to make sure a clean
workspace builds. Also, you must, MUST run the tests. All tests must
pass before checking in the code.
