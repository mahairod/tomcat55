The package org.apache.jspxml contains the utility classes to generate the XML view of JSP pages. The file jsp2XML.java contains the code to convert a jsp page to its XML view. The file FileLister.java is ussed to get all the jsp files in subdirectories of a given directory. The file jsp2XMLTarget has the code to generate the jsp-gtest-xml.xml file which has the XML targets.The file GetWorkspaceInXML.java  uses these classes to convert all the jsp file in webappas/jsp-tests/jsp directory to XML files. These files are built and packaged into testdriver.jaar file.
  Right now, These tools work fine.jsp2XML is basically a pattern matching tool that parses the jsp file and generates the XML file. It's not very robust thoughat this point. A badly written jsp file can easily break the code. (for ex. using unnecessary whitespaces in jsp elements) . But it works fine with most of the jsp's (All of the JSP's in watchdog).The following things are not yet implemented in this tool.
1)JSP quoting conventions
2)New Namespaces based ob the type of URI in taglibs.
