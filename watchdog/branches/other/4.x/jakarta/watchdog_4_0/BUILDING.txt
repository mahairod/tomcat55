                Building The Watchdog 4.0 Validation Test Suite
                ===========================================

This subproject contains a set of tests to assist you in validating whether
your servlet container conforms to the requirements of the Servlet 2.3 and
JSP 1.2 specifications.  In order to build these tests from a source
distribution, you must do the following:

(0) Download and Install a Java Development Kit

* Download a Java Development Kit (JDK) release (version 1.3 or later) from:

    http://java.sun.com/j2se/

* Install the JDK according to the instructions included with the release.

* Set an environment variable JAVA_HOME to the pathname of the directory
  into which you installed the JDK release.


(1) Download and Install the Ant Binary Distribution

NOTE:  These instructions assume that you are using the Ant 1.4 or above. 

* Download a binary distribution of Ant 1.4 from:

    http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-ant/release/v1.4/bin/

  On a Windows platform, you will need:
    jakarta-ant-1.4-bin.zip
    jakarta-ant-1.4-optional.jar

  On a Unix platform, you will need:
    jakarta-ant-1.4-bin.tar.gz
    jakarta-ant-1.4-optional.jar

* Unpack the binary distribution into a convenient location so that the
  Ant release resides in its own directory (conventionally named
  "jakarta-ant-1.4").  For the purposes of the remainder of this document,
  the symbolic name "${ant.home}" is used to refer to the full pathname of
  the release directory.

* Copy the file "jakarta-ant-1.4-optional.jar", downloaded above, into
  the directory "${ant.home}/lib".  This makes available several Ant
  extension commands that are commonly required when building Jakarta
  based projects.

* Modify the PATH environment variable to include directory
  "${ant.home}/bin" in its list.  This makes the "ant" command line script
  available, which will be used to actually perform the build.


(2) Download and Install the Java XML Pack Binary Distribution

NOTE:  Although this step is not required to build this particular subproject,
it is commonly required to build other Jakarta projects.  Hence, the steps
required are documented here.

* Download a binary distribution of Java XML Pack:

    http://java.sun.com/xml/downloads/javaxmlpack.html

* Unpack the binary distribution into a convenient location so that the
  Java XML Pack release resides in its own directory (the JAXP libraries
  reside in the jaxp-1.1.3 subdirectory).  For the purposes of the
  remainder of this document, the symbolic name "${jaxp.home}" is used
  to refer to the full pathname to the jaxp-1.1.3 subdirectory of
  the Java XML Pack release directory.

* Make the "xalan.jar" file of this distribution available to Ant
  (so that it can be used with the <style> tag) by copying it to
  "${ant.home}/lib".

* This is optional with JDK 1.4 or later.


(3) Download and Install Subproject Source Code

* Use Anonymous CVS (as described on the Jakarta web site at
  <http://jakarta.apache.org/site/cvsindex.html>, or
  download a source distribution from:

    http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-watchdog-4.0/nightly/src/

  On a Windows platform, you will need:
    jakarta-watchdog-4.0-src-YYYYMMDD.zip

  On a Unix platform, you will need:
    jakarta-watchdog-4.0-src-YYYYMMDD.zip

* Unpack the source distribution into a convenient location so that the
  distribution resides in its own directory (conventionally named
  "jakarta-watchdog-4.0").  For the purposes of the remainder of this document,
  the symbolic name "${watchdog.source}" is used to refer to the full
  pathname of the release directory.


(4) Download and Install the Servlet API Binary Distribution

NOTE:  Alternatively, you can download the sources of the
"jakarta-servletapi-4" and "jakarta-servletapi" subprojects, 
and build a binary distribution yourself.

* Download a binary distribution of the jakarta-servletapi-4
  (this includes the classes for Servlet 2.3 and JSP 1.2) from:

    http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-servletapi-4/nightly/

  On a Windows platform, you will need:
    jakarta-servletapi-4-YYYYMMDD.zip

  On a Unix platform, you will need:
    jakarta-servletapi-4-YYYYMMDD.zip

* Download a binary distribution of the jakarta-servletapi 
  (this includes the classes for Servlet 2.2 and JSP 1.1) from:

    http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-tomcat/release/v3.3/bin/

  On a Windows platform, you will need:
    jakarta-servletapi.zip

  On a Unix platform, you will need:
    jakarta-servletapi.tar.gz

* Unpack the binary distribution into a convenient location so that the
  distribution resides in its own directory (conventionally named
  "jakarta-servletapi-4" for Servlet2.3 and JSP1.2 and "jakarta-servletapi"
  for Servlet 2.2 and JSP 1.1).  For the purposes of the remainder of this document,
  the symbolic name "${servlet23api.home}" is used to refer to the full
  pathname of the jakarta-servletapi-4 release directory and the symbolic
  name, "${servlet22api.home} is used to refer to the full pathname of the
  jakarta-servletapi release directory.

* Make a note of the full pathname to the "servlet.jar" file included (in
  the "lib" subdirectory of each of the distributions).  
  You will need it in the next step.


(5) Customize Build Properties For This Subproject

Most Jakarta subprojects allow you to customize Ant properties (with default
values defined in the "build.xml" file.  This is done by creating a text file
named "build.properties" in the source distribution directory (for property
definitions local to this subproject) and/or your user home directory (for
property definitions shared across subprojects).  You can use the included
"build.properties.sample" file as a starting point for this.

Watchdog has an external dependency on a compiled version of the Servlet and
JSP API classes, conventionally distributed in a file named "servlet.jar".
You can utilize such a JAR file from the "jakarta-servletapi-4"
subproject (as described in the previous step), or use the "servlet.jar" file
delivered with your servlet container.

Create (or update) a "build.properties" file in your "${watchdog.source}"
directory, or in your user home directory, and set the values of 
servlet23api.home and servlet22api.home to the fully qualified pathnames
of the respective distributions.  For example:

  servlet23api.home=/usr/local/jakarta-servletapi-4
  servlet22api.home=/usr/local/jakarta-servletapi


(6) Build A Binary Distribution

Open a command line shell, and issue the following commands:

  cd ${watchdog.source}
  ant -projecthelp

If everything is installed correctly, you should see a list of the Ant
"targets" that represent different commands you might wish to build.  By
convention, the "dist" target creates a complete binary distribution.  To
execute it, type the following commands:

  cd ${watchdog.source}
  ant dist

This will create a complete binary distribution of the subproject (equivalent
in structure to the corresponding binary distribution downloadable from the
Jakarta web site), in the "${watchdog.source}/dist" directory.  It will have
the contents described in the corresponding "README.txt" file.

See the document RUNNING.txt for instructions on how to run the test suite
against your servlet container.
