    alter this file to add new custom tests 

    There is an entity defined here called 'custom-tests' which has a list of
    top-level elements for the tests. These top-level elements will be defined
    in the resulting DTD to appear as children of the <validate> element in 
    a Latka Suite

    Each custom test top-level element should be entered, with a vertical
    bar ( '|' ) separating each.
-->

<!--top level element only, e.g.
    the vertical bar is VERY important
### example only
    custom-tests " | myvalidator" >

    default is no custom tests i.e. blank
 -->
<!ENTITY % custom-tests "" >

<!-- 
now for custom test element and attribute definitions, e.g.

### example only
<!ELEMENT myvalidator EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST myvalidator name  CDATA #REQUIRED
                      value CDATA #IMPLIED
                      label CDATA #IMPLIED>
