        Java Servlet and JSP Implementation Classes
        ===========================================

This subproject contains the source code for the implementation classes of the
Java Servlet and JSP APIs (packages javax.servlet).  In order to build these
sources successfully, you must do the following:

* Download and install the Java API for XML Parsing implementation (current
  version number is 1.0) from <http://java.sun.com/xml/>.  Make sure that the
  "jaxp.jar" and "parser.jar" files are on your class path.

* Download and install the JAKARTA-ANT distribution.  If you have downloaded
  the source distribution, you must create the executable version by
  executing the following commands:

    cd jakarta-ant
    ./bootstrap.sh      <-- Unix
    bootstrap           <-- Windows

  This should result in the creation of a file "ant.jar" in the "lib"
  subdirectory, which will be used when building the Servlet API distribution.

* Download and install the JAKARTA-SERVLETAPI source code, or check it out
  from the CVS repository, into a directory parallel to the jakarta-ant
  directory created above.  That is, if you downloaded both subprojects into
  a directory named $JAKARTA_HOME, you would see the following two entries:

    jakarta-ant/
    jakarta-servletapi/

  underneath it.

* Build the servlet API distribution (a "servlet.jar" file containing the
  classes and a ZIP file containing the API documentation) as follows:

    cd jakarta-servletapi
    ./build.sh dist     <-- Unix
    build dist          <-- Windows

  This should result in the creation of a new "dist" directory at the same
  level as "jakarta-ant" and "jakarta-servletapi", with a "servletapi"
  directory underneath it.  In this distribution directory, you will find:

    docs/api/       Directory containing the Javadoc API
                    documentation for the servlet/JSP API classes

    lib/servlet.jar     Binary servlet classes suitable
                        for use when compiling servlets
                        (or a servlet container)

    src/            Directory containing the source code
                    for the servlet/JSP API classes
