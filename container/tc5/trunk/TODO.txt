* Filter mapping optimization (remm)
* Tag plugins for JSTL
* Optimization of BASIC authentication handling (remm)
* (optional) Optimization of DIGEST authentication handling
* (optional) Realm / auth refactoring (one of the goals would be to add better 
  support for DIGEST)
* (optional) GUI for the deployer
* (optional) Stack size reduction (removal of valves to improve runtime 
  performance and ease debugging)
* Deployer refactoring (remm)
* Documentation updates for new user guide book (remm)
* Split main catalina.jar (remm)
* Scalability improvements: merge threads at the server level responsible for:
  session expiration (1 per webapp), webapp deployment and reloading (1 per 
  host), webapp class reloading (1 per webapp if used). A new method should be
  introduced in the Container interface; this thread would peridically invoke
  that method on the whole Container tree. (remm)
