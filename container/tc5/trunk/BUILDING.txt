                 Building The Tomcat 5 Servlet/JSP Container
                 ===========================================

This subproject contains the source code for Tomcat 5, a container that
implements the Servlet 2.4 and JSP 2.0 specifications from the Java
Community Process <http://www.jcp.org/>.  In order to build a binary
distribution version of the container from a source distribution, 
do the following:


(0) Download and Install a Java Development Kit

* If the JDK is already installed, skip to (1).

* Download a Java Development Kit (JDK) release (version 1.4 or later) from:

    http://java.sun.com/j2se/

* Install the JDK according to the instructions included with the release.

* Set an environment variable JAVA_HOME to the pathname of the directory
  into which you installed the JDK release.


(1) Install Apache Ant 1.5.1 on your computer

* If Apache Ant 1.5.1 is already installed on your computer, skip to (2).

(1.1) Download and Install the Ant Binary Distribution

* Download a binary distribution of Ant 1.5.1 from:

    http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-ant/release/v1.5.1/bin/

  On a Windows platform, you will need:
    jakarta-ant-1.5.1-bin.zip

  On a Unix platform, you will need:
    jakarta-ant-1.5.1-bin.tar.gz

* Unpack the binary distribution into a convenient location so that the
  Ant release resides in its own directory (conventionally named
  "jakarta-ant-1.5.1").  For the purposes of the remainder of this document,
  the symbolic name "${ant.home}" is used to refer to the full pathname of
  the release directory.

* Modify the PATH environment variable to include the directory
  ${ant.home}/bin in its list.  This makes the "ant" command line script
  available, which will be used to actually perform the build.


(1.2) Download and Install the Xalan 2 Distribution

* Download a binary distribution of Xalan version 2.x from:

  http://xml.apache.org/dist/xalan-j/

  On a Windows platform, you probably want:
    Xerces-J-bin.2.x.y.zip

  On a Unix platform, you probably want:
    Xerces-J-bin.2.x.y.tar.gz

* Unpack the binary distribution into a convenient location so that the
  distribution resides in its own directory (conventionally named
  "xalan-2_x_y").

* Copy the xalan.jar file from that distribution to the ${ant.home}/lib	
  directory.


(2) Building Tomcat 5

(2.1) Download main build script and build binary distribution

* Download the main build.xml script from:
  http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-tomcat/build-5/build.xml

* Create a new directory, and copy the newly download build.xml to it. This
  directory will be referred to as the ${tomcat.source} directory in the rest
  of this document

(2.2) Building

* Go to that directory, and do:

    cd ${tomcat.source}
    ant

* NOTE: Users accessing the Internet through a proxy must use a properties
  file to indicate to Ant the proxy configuration. Read below.

* WARNING: Running this command will checkout the Tomcat 5 sources from CVS, as
  well as download binaries to the /usr/local directory. Make sure this is
  appropriate to do on your computer. On Windows, this usually corresponds
  to the "C:\usr\local" directory, unless Cygwin is used. Read below to 
  customize the directory used to download the binaries.

* The build can be controlled by creating a ${tomcat.source}/build.properties
  file, and adding the following content to it:

    # ----- Proxy setup -----
    # Uncomment if using a proxy server
    #proxy.host=proxy.domain
    #proxy.port=8080
    #proxy.use=on

    # ----- Default Base Path for Dependent Packages -----
    # Replace this path with the directory path where dependencies binaries
    # should be downloaded
    base.path=/usr/local


(3) Updating sources

It is recommended that you regularly update the downloaded Tomcat 5 sources. 
To do this, execute the following commands:

    cd ${tomcat.source}
    ant checkout


(4) Rebuilds

For a quick rebuild of only modified code you can use 
   
    cd ${tomcat.source}
    ant build

In addition, "ant build-depends" will build packages that 
tomcat depends on ( commons-logging for now ), to ease fixes
and debuging in those packages.
