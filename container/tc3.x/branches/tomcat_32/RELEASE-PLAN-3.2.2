NOTE:  This document is the first cut at a release plan for the next
       dot release of Tomcat.  Nothing in this document should be

			Tomcat 3.2.2 Release Plan
			=========================

Objective: 

    The objective of the Tomcat 3.2.2 release is to make the bug
    fixes that have been made to the Tomcat 3.2 branch since the 
    release of Tomcat 3.2.1 available in a public release.


Plan:

    Because the code base for the 3.2 branch has been quite stable,
    only a single two week beta release is planned prior to the 
    final release.  If bugs are found during the beta cycle that 
    require non-trivial code changes to fix, then a second two week
    beta release will be made and the date for the final release
    will be moved back accordingly.
    
    The code freeze date proposed below is to allow time for a
    release plan vote to be held on tomcat-dev and to allow developers 
    time to complete fixes that they feel should be included in this 
    release.

    Tomcat 3.2.2 Beta Release:

        Code Freeze/Tag Date:   February 25, 2001
        Release Manager:        Marc Saegesser

        The beta release will allow users to install and verify
        bugs fixed in Tomcat 3.2.2 and to verify that no new
        bugs have been introduced. 
    
        The RELEASE-NOTES file will be updated to indicate bugs
        that have been fixed in this release.

    Tomcat 3.2.2 Final Release:

        Code Freeze/Tag Date:   March 11, 2001
        Release Manager:        Marc Saegesser


Release Criteria:
    
    Any bug introduced by a code change since Tomcat 3.2.1 was released MUST
    be fixed.  If it worked in 3.2.1 it will work in 3.2.2.

    All Bugzilla items opened against "Tocmat 3" must be marked as RESOLVED.
    Those items that are not going to be fixed in Tomcat 3.2.2 will be given
    a resolution of LATER.  After Tomcat 3.2.2 is released items marked LATER
    will be re-opened and may then be addressed in a future release.

    The Tomcat 3.2.2 release MUST run the jakarta-watchdog test suite with no 
    errors on the following platforms:  Linux, Solaris, Windows 9x, 
    Windows NT/2000.  It is desirable to have successful test reports on 
    MacOS 9/X, and FreeBSD.
    
    A release vote must be held on the tomcat-dev mailing list and the vote
    must pass by "Majority Approval".
