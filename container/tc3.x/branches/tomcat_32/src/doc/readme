=============================================================================
1.  INTRODUCTION

Tomcat is a servlet container and JavaServer Pages(tm) implementation.  It may
be used stand alone, or in conjunction with several popular web servers:
- Apache, version 1.3 or later
- Microsoft Internet Information Server, version 4.0 or later
- Microsoft Personal Web Server, version 4.0 or later
- Netscape Enterprise Server, version 3.0 or later

You should read the License Agreement (in the LICENSE file of the top level
directory), which applies to all software included in this release.

Tomcat Version 3.2.2 is a bug fix release.  No new features have been
added in this release.  The bugs known to be fixed in Version 3.2.2
are described in section 7.1 below.

=============================================================================
2.  INSTALLING AND RUNNING TOMCAT

Tomcat requires a Java Runtime Environment conformant to JRE 1.1 or later,
including any Java2 platform system.  If you wish to develop applications,
you will need a Java compiler, such as the one included in a Java Development
Kit 1.1 or later environment, including JDKs conformant with Java2.

For detailed information about installing and running Tomcat, point your
browser at file "doc/uguide/tomcat_ug.html" under the directory into which
you unpacked the Tomcat distribution.


=============================================================================
3.  APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT USING TOMCAT

Preliminary information on using Tomcat for developing Servlet/JSP based
applications is provided in the included Application Developer's Guide.
Point your browser at file "doc/appdev/index.html" under the directory into
which you unpacked the Tomcat distribution.


=============================================================================
4.  TOMCAT: PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE

- Version 3.0 (released 12/1999) was the initial release of Tomcat.  In 
addition to implementing the Java Servlet and Server Pages specification, 
this release featured a minimal Apache connector.

- Tomcat 3.1 (released 4/2000) improved the Apache connection and added 
connector support for Netscape and IIS web servers. It also added WAR file 
support, automatic servlet reloading, and a command line tool (jspc) to 
compile ahead of time the JSP pages that comprise your application.  Finally, 
version 3.1 also focused on reorganizing the code (modularization, cleanup, 
refactoring, removal of dead code, and separation of J2EE-specific code).

- Tomcat 3.2 was the first performance tune-up, and also added a few new 
features.

- Tomcat 3.2.1 was a security update.  See section 7.3 for details.

- Tomcat 3.2.2 is a bug fix release.  Section 7.1 describes the issues
that have been fixed in the version.

- Tomcat 4.0 is separate development from Tomcat 3.x.  It is based on the
Catalina architecture, which is very different from the architecture of
Tomcat 3.x.  In addition, Tomcat 4.0 is to be the reference implementation
for the Servlet 2.3 and JSP 1.2 specifications.


=============================================================================
5.  NEW FEATURES IN THIS RELEASE

5.1 Docbase and File Based Localization

Tomcat 3.2.2 now supports a method mapping requests into localized resources
automatically based on the client's and the server's locale.  Localized
content can be organized using one directory per locale (Docbase) or
into a single directory the locale specified in the file names (File based).

A detailed description of this feature can be found in 
doc/tomcat-localization-how.html


=============================================================================
6.  KNOWN BUGS AND ISSUES

6.1 Using An Absolute Path as Document Root Under Windows

In the TOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml file, you can declare a relative or absolute
directory pathname for the docBase attribute.  If you wish to use an absolute
pathname on a Windows system, you MUST include the drive letter in order to
conform to Java's definition of an absolute path on this platform:

    GOOD:  c:\mydirectory\mydocbase
    GOOD:  c:/mydirectory/mydocbase
    BAD:   \mydirectory\mydocbase
    BAD:   /mydirectory/mydocbase

Under Unix, absolute pathnames must begin with a slash ('/') character.

6.2 Container Managed Security

Tomcat 3.2 has an implementation of container managed security,	as
described in the Servlet API Specification, version 2.2, section 11.
Please note the following information about this implementation:

- BASIC and FORM based authentication should work correctly.  Please
  report any bugs you encounter here at <http://jakarta.apache.org/site/bugs.html>.
  The example application has a protected area defined at the following URL:

	http://localhost:8080/examples/jsp/security/protected

  which can be accessed by any user defined in the configuration file
  $TOMCAT_HOME/conf/tomcat-users.xml that has been granted the
  appropriate roles.  Form-based authentication is used by default,
  but a commented out setting for Basic authentication is provided if
  you wish to give it a try.

  WARNING:  Basic authentication is not suitable for general security
  use across the Internet, or across other insecure networks, because
  usernames and passwords are sent encoded, but not encrypted, with
  every single request.

- DIGEST authentication and HTTPS client authentication (i.e. SSL)
  are not supported in this release.

6.3 Using RequestDispatcher.include() on a Welcome File [Bug Report #160]

Using the following technique results in a response with incorrect content:

- You have a subdirectory under your document root
  (for example "subdir/").

- This subdirectory contains a welcome file that you
  have configured to be displayed when that subdirectory
  is requested on a URL (for example "index.html").

- You request a RequestDispatcher for path "/subdir"
  or path "/subdir/" and then call include() on it.

The same problem can occur when you do a <jsp:include/> to a page "/subdir"
or "/subdir/" as well.

A workaround is to ask for a RequestDispatcher on the complete context-
relative path of the file you wish to have displayed, such as
"/subdir/index.html".

6.4 Automatic Servlet Reloading

Tomcat 3.2 includes a feature whereby you can ask it to automatically
reload servlet classes (loaded from either the WEB-INF/classes directory
or a JAR file in the WEB-INF/lib directory) that have been changed.  This
feature is experimental, and may not be completely functional.  In particular,
changes to classes other than the servlet you are requesting do not trigger
class reloads -- you will need to restart Tomcat to reflect changes in those
classes.

Reloading is enabled by including a reloadable="true" attribute on the
<Context> element in the "conf/server.xml" file.  Note that automatic
reload support is not recommended for production applications because of
its experimental nature, and the extra overhead required to perform the
necessary checks on every request.

6.5 Avoiding "Out of environment space" errors on Windows 95/98

This error can easily occur since the default amount of environment space is
typically insufficient to run Tomcat.  Here are a couple of ways to avoid it.

  A. If you use the MS-DOS Prompt to start Tomcat, execute Programs ->
     MS-DOS Prompt.  Right-click the MS-DOS icon on the left of the title bar
     and select Properties at the bottom of the menu.  In the MS-DOS Prompt
     Properties dialog select the Memory tab.  In the "Initial environment:"
     field, set a sufficiently high number.  If you are not sure, 3072 should
     be plenty.  Click OK and close the MS-DOS Prompt window.  Execute
     Programs -> MS-DOS Prompt again, navigate to the directory where you
     installed Tomcat.  Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable if not set
     already.  You should be able to execute "bin\startup" and "bin\shutdown"
     to start and stop Tomcat without getting an "Out of environment space"
     error.

  B. If you want to start Tomcat by double clicking a batch file such as
     startup.bat, you should right-click on the desired batch file in Windows
     Explorer and select Properties to open the MS-DOS Prompt Properties
     dialog.  Select the Memory tab and set the "Initial environment:" as
     described above.  You may want to also select the Program tab and check
     "Close on exit".  Then click OK.  A shortcut with these settings will be
     created in same directory with the same base name as the batch file.  You
     should be able to double-click the shortcut or the batch file to execute
     without getting an "Out of environment space" error.  If you wish to
     execute startup.bat and shutdown.bat in this fashion, you will need to do
     the above for both files.  In addition, you need to provide for setting
     JAVA_HOME.  This may be done by adding a "SET JAVA_HOME=path to your jdk"
     line to your autoexec.bat or to the startup.bat and shutdown.bat files
     themselves.

6.6 URL's are now case sensitive on all operating systems

As of Tomcat 3.2, URL's are case sensitive for all operating systems,
including operating systems which have case insensitive file systems, such as
Windows.  This represents a change from Tomcat 3.1, where URL's were case
insensitive on case insensitive OS's.  This was done for a number of reasons,
security and portability among them.

A "non-portable" web application, i.e. one with case mismatches, which worked
on a case insensitive OS under Tomcat 3.1 will show its non-portability when
run under Tomcat 3.2.

This can also cause URL's that look correct to actually be incorrect.  In
Windows Explorer, a directory whose name fits within the MS-DOS 8.3 format
may be displayed using a "formated" name.  For example, a directory named
"MYDIR" may display as "Mydir".  A URL like "http://localhost/mysite/Mydir/
index.jsp" would return "File Not Found" because the correct URL would be
"http://localhost/mysite/MYDIR/index.jsp".  If you find URL's being
mysteriously "not found", check for case mismatch.  Use the Windows Explorer
Properties dialog or an MS-DOS window to check the actual case of the file
and directory names.

This can cause an additional problem when Tomcat is used with a case
insensitive web server, such as IIS, where the web server serves the static
content.  The web server could serve a static page with mismatched case in the
URL. If that static page contains relative links to resources served by
Tomcat, then invoking those links would carry the mismatched case to Tomcat
where it cause the resource not to be found.

6.7 Generated Configuration Files for Web Connectors

At startup time, Tomcat normally generates configuration files like
"tomcat-apache.conf" to reflect the contexts that are defined.  However, the
generated files do NOT reflect any configuration settings found inside the
web application deployment descriptor file (web.xml) for your application.
You will need to configure any such settings that are relevant directly into
your web server's configuration files.

This is a known limitation of the design of the web connectors for Tomcat 3.2,
and will be addressed by the introduction of the MOD_WARP connector in
Tomcat 4.0.

6.8 Limitation on Form Based Login

If the pages you specify for <form-login-page> or <form-error-page> are within
the area protected by a security constraint, Tomcat 3.2 will be unable to
display them.  As a side effect of this problem, you will not be able to use
a URL pattern of "/*" to protect your entire web application when using form
based login.

A workaround is to set up your web application with the form login page and
form error page in the document root directory, place all other pages in one
or more subdirectories, and establish security constraints to protect the
subdirectories.

6.9 Limitation on Document Base Paths

Tomcat 3.2 is unable to support Windows SMB paths in a <Context> directive
like this:

        <Context path="/ctx" docBase="\\machine\share\path" />

although this approach was supported in Tomcat 3.1, and is supported in
Tomcat 4.0.  A workaround is to establish a drive mapping to "\\machine\share"
and define your context like this:

        <Context path="/ctx" docBase="r:\path" />

where "r:" is mapped to this share.

6.10 Resource Paths Can't Contain URL Escapes

The path passed to javax.servlet.Context.getResource() and
javax.servlet.Context.getResrouceAsStream() cannot contain URL escapes of
the form %HH.  Paths containing any URL escapes will return null.

6.11 AJP12 and SSL

The AJP12 protocol does not provide a mechanism for identifying requests
that arrived on a secure transport (e.g. SSL).  Tomcat assumes that any
request that arrived on server port 443 is secure and sets the URL scheme
to HTTPS.  Requests on any other port are assumed to be non-secure and
will indicate a URL scheme of HTTP.  The AJP13 protocol does not suffer
from this problem.

7.2 Security vulnerabilities fixed in Tomcat 3.2.2

7.2.1 HTTP Requests With no Protocol

An HTTP request with no protocol specified would return an unprocessed
source for a JSP file.  For example

GET /examples/jsp/num/numguess.jsp 

would return the source for the numguess.jsp file.

7.2.2

Tomcat 3.2.2 beta releases prior to beta 3 had allowed URI components
to be decoded twice.  This problem only appears when using JDK 1.3.0
or later.  The double decode problem caused URL such as

http://localhost:8080/%252e%252e/%252e%252e/%00.jsp

to reveal a directory listing outside the web application.  Other
versions of this same double decode attack could reveal the contents
of files outside the web application.


7.3 Security vulnerabilities fixed in Tomcat 3.2.1

7.3.1 Protection of Resources in /WEB-INF and /META-INF Directories

The servlet specification prohibits servlet containers from serving resources
in the /WEB-INF and /META-INF directories of a web application archive directly
to clients.  In Tomcat 3.2, this means that URLs like:

   http://localhost:8080/examples/WEB-INF/web.xml

will return an error message, rather than the contents of your deployment
descriptor.  However, there is a vulnerability in Tomcat 3.2 that exposes
this information if the client requests a URL like this instead:

    http://localhost:8080/examples//WEB-INF/web.xml

(note the double slash before "WEB-INF").  This vulnerability has been
corrected in Tomcat 3.2.1.


7.3.2 Show Source Vulnerability

The example application delivered with Tomcat 3.2 included a mechanism to
display the source code for the JSP page examples.  This mechanism could
be used to bypass the restrictions on displaying sensitive information in
the WEB-INF and META-INF directories.  This vulnerability has been removed.
