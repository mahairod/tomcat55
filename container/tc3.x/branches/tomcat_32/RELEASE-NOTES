=============================================================================
1.  INTRODUCTION

Tomcat is a servlet container and JavaServer Pages(tm) implementation.  It may
be used stand alone, or in conjunction with several popular web servers:
- Apache, version 1.3 or later
- Microsoft Internet Information Server, version 4.0 or later
- Microsoft Personal Web Server, version 4.0 or later
- Netscape Enterprise Server, version 3.0 or later

You should read the License Agreement (in the LICENSE file of the top level
directory), which applies to all software included in this release.

This document adds descriptions of the bug fixes and enhancements that have
been added in update releases of Tomcat 3.2 since the original release.  See
Section 7 for details.


=============================================================================
2.  INSTALLING AND RUNNING TOMCAT

Tomcat requires a Java Runtime Environment conformant to JRE 1.1 or later,
including any Java2 platform system.  If you wish to develop applications,
you will need a Java compiler, such as the one included in a Java Development
Kit 1.1 or later environment, including JDKs conformant with Java2.

For detailed information about installing and running Tomcat, point your
browser at file "doc/uguide/tomcat_ug.html" under the directory into which
you unpacked the Tomcat distribution or see the documentation at
http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/index.html.


=============================================================================
3.  APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT USING TOMCAT

Preliminary information on using Tomcat for developing Servlet/JSP based
applications is provided in the included Application Developer's Guide.
Point your browser at file "doc/appdev/index.html" under the directory into
which you unpacked the Tomcat distribution.


=============================================================================
4.  TOMCAT: PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE

- Version 3.0 (released 12/1999) was the initial release of Tomcat.  In
addition to implementing the Java Servlet and Server Pages specification,
this release featured a minimal Apache connector.

- Tomcat 3.1 (released 4/2000) improved the Apache connection and added
connector support for Netscape and IIS web servers. It also added WAR file
support, automatic servlet reloading, and a command line tool (jspc) to
compile the JSP pages that comprise your application in advance of
deployment.  Finally, version 3.1 also focused on reorganizing the code
(modularization, cleanup, refactoring, removal of dead code, and separation
of J2EE-specific code).

- Tomcat 3.2 is the first performance tune-up, and also adds a few new
features (see next section).

- Tomcat 3.2.2 is a bug fix release that collects the fixes that have 
been applied since version 3.2.1 was released.

- It is expected that Tomcat 3.3 will feature additional major performance
improvements resulting from changes in data representation and algorithms.
Version 3.3 will also undergo a major review of security  (to be able to
trust that "untrusted" code runs safely), and support for I18N character
sets.

=============================================================================
5.  NEW FEATURES IN THIS RELEASE

Tomcat 3.2.2 is strictly a bug fix release.  No new features have been
added.

=============================================================================
6.  KNOWN BUGS AND ISSUES

6.1 Using An Absolute Path as Document Root Under Windows

In the TOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml file, you can declare a relative or absolute
directory pathname for the docRoot attribute.  If you wish to use an absolute
pathname on a Windows system, you MUST include the drive letter in order to
conform to Java's definition of an absolute path on this platform:

    GOOD:  c:\mydirectory\mydocroot
    GOOD:  c:/mydirectory/mydocroot
    BAD:   \mydirectory\mydocroot
    BAD:   /mydirectory/mydocroot

Under Unix, absolute pathnames must begin with a slash ('/') character.
