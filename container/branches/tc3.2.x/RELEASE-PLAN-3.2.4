			Tomcat 3.2.4 Release Plan
			=========================

Objective: 

    The objective of the Tomcat 3.2.4 release is to provide an official 
    release of all the bug fixes that have been made to the tomcat_32 branch 
    since the release of Tomcat 3.2.3.  



Plan:

    Tomcat 3.2.4 Beta Release:

        Code Freeze/Tag Date:   October 25, 2001
        Release Manager:        Marc Saegesser

        The beta release will allow users to install and verify
        bugs fixed in Tomcat 3.2.4 and to verify that no new
        bugs have been introduced. 
    
        The RELEASE-NOTES file will be updated to indicate bugs
        that have been fixed in this release.

    Tomcat 3.2.4 Final Release:

        Code Freeze/Tag Date:   November 8, 2001
        Release Manager:        Marc Saegesser


Release Criteria:
    
There are currently two unresolved bugs open against Tomcat 3.  These bugs 
will be resolved prior to the beta release.  

Tomcat 3 - 3983  Uploading files.   I can't duplicate the problem.  Waiting
                 for additional information from the reporter.
Tomcat 3 - 4260  PageContextImpl cast.  The proposed change is minor, but I'm
                 not sure why there is a problem.  This may turn out to be a
		 platform issue.  In any event it will be resolved quickly.
		 
New bugs reported during the beta release will be evaluated and resolved 
prior to the final release.  Depending on impact some of these bugs may be 
resolved as LATER in which case they will be addressed in a subsequent 
3.2.x release or Tomcat 3.3.
