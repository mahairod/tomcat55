<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>An <b>Engine</b> component represents the entire Catalina servlet
container.  Normally, a single instance of an <b>Engine</b> component
is configured to receive all requests received by one or more
<a href="connector.html">Connector</a> components.  This element will
be nested immediately after the <code>&lt;Connector&gt;</code> elements,
inside a <code>&lt;Server&gt;</code> element.</p>

<p>Request processing <a href="valve.html">Valves</a> that are specified
here will be executed for every request received from every connector.</p>

<br>

<a name="Common Attributes"></a>
<h2>Common Attributes</h2>

<p>All implementations of the <b>Engine</b> component support the following
attributes, which are configured in an <code>&lt;Engine&gt;</code> element:</p>

<table border="1" width="100%">

  <tr>
    <th width="15%">Attribute</th>
    <th width="85%">Description</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>className</code></td>
    <td>Java class name of the implementation to use.  This class must
        implement the <code>org.apache.tomcat.Engine</code> interface.  If
        no class name is specified, the standard implementation will be
        used (<code>org.apache.tomcat.core.StandardEngine</code>).
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>name</code></td>
    <td>The logical name of this engine.  The name selected is arbitrary,
        but it is required.
    </td>
  </tr>

</table>

<br>

<a name="Standard Implementation Attributes"></a>
<h2>Standard Implementation Attributes</h2>

<p>The standard implementation of the <b>Engine</b> component supports the
following attributes in addition to those supported by all implementations:
</p>

<table border="1" width="100%">

  <tr>
    <th width="15%">Attribute</th>
    <th width="85%">Description</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>debug</code></td>
    <td>
      The level of debugging detail logged by this Engine to the associated
      Logger, with higher numbers generating more detailed output.  If not
      specified, the debugging detail level will be set to zero (0).
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>defaultHost</code></td>
    <td>Normally, requests which specify a <code>Host:</code> HTTP
        header are forwarded to a <a href="host.html">Host</a> with
        a matching name or alias.  If a request is received with a
        requested host name that is not recognized, it will be
        forwarded to the <b>Host</b> named here.  If not specified,
        such requests will be returned with an HTTP error instead.
    </td>
  </tr>

</table>

<br>

<a name="Utility Components"></a>
<h2>Utility Components</h2>

<p>You can attach one or more of the following utility components by nesting
a corresponding declaration element inside your <b>Host</b> element.  Unless
overridden by a utility component of the same name being nested in a
<a href="context.html">Context</a> element, the utility components you
declare here will be shared among all web applications running in this
<b>Host</b>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="logger.html">Logger</a> - Configure a logger that will receive
      all log messages from this <b>Engine</b>, plus log messages from
      <a href="connector.html">Connectors</a> attached to this Engine.  In
      addition, this Logger will log messages from subordinate
      <a href="host.html">Hosts</a> and <a href="context.html">Contexts</a>,
      unless overridden by a Logger configuration at a lower level.
  </li>
  <li><a href="realm.html">Realm</a> - Configure a realm that will allow your
      database of users, and their associated roles, to be shared across all
      of the Hosts, and all web applications running within these Hosts.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Special Features</h2>

<h3>Access Logs</h3>

<p>When you run a web server, one of the output files normally generated is
an <i>access log</i>, which generates one line of information, in a standard
format, for each HTTP request that was received, and responded to, by the
web server.  Catalina includes an optional <a href="valve.html">Valve</a>
implementation that can create access logs in the same standard format
created by web servers, or in any custom format desired.</p>

<p>You can ask Catalina to create an access log for all requests to any
web application for any <b>Host</b>, by nesting an element like this inside
your <b>Engine</b> element:</p>
<pre>

    &lt;Engine name="engine" ...&gt;
      ...
      &lt;Valve className="org.apache.tomcat.valves.AccessLogValve"
             prefix="catalina_access_log." suffix=".txt"
             pattern="common"/&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/Engine&gt;

</pre>

<p>See <a href="valve.html#FIXME">Access Log Valve</a> for more
information on the configuration options that are supported.</p>

<h3>Lifecycle Listeners</h3>

<p>If you have implemented a Java object that needs to know when this Engine
is started or stopped, you can declare it by nesting a
<code>&lt;Listener&gt;</code> element inside the <code>&lt;Engine&gt;</code>
element.  The class you specify in the <code>className</code> attribute
of this Listener must implement the
<code>org.apache.tomcat.LifecycleListener</code> interface, and it will be
notified about the occurrence of the corresponding lifecycle events.</p>

<p>Configuration for such a listener might look like this:</p>
<pre>

    &lt;Engine name="engine" ...&gt;
      ...
      &lt;Listener className="com.mycompany.MyEngineListener"/&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/Engine&gt;

</pre>

<p>See <a href="listener.html">Listeners</a> for more information about
lifecycle listeners.</p>

<h3>Request Filters</h3>

<p>You can ask Catalina to check the IP address, or host name, of an
incoming request for the entire servlet container
against a list of "accept" and "deny" filters, which are
defined using the Regular Expression syntax supported by the jakarta-regexp
regular expression library system.  Requests that come from remote locations
that are not accepted will be rejected with an HTTP "Forbidden" error.  An
example configuration that rejects requests from any domain except
"mycompany.com") would be:</p>
<pre>

    &lt;Engine name="engine" ...&gt;
      ...
      &lt;Valve className="org.apache.tomcat.valves.RemoteHostValve"
             allow="*.mycompany.com"/&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/Engine&gt;

</pre>

<p>See <a href="valve.html#FIXME">Request Filter Valve</a> for more
information on the syntax of the filters, and the logic that is applied
when they are executed.</p>
