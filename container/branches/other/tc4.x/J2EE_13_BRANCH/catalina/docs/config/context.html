<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A <b>Context</b> component represents an individual web application that
is running within a particular <a href="host.html">Host</a>.  Such a web
application is based on a directory whose organization is described in the
Servlet API Specification, version 2.2 -- including the web application
deployment descriptor file, found in "WEB-INF/web.xml".</p>

<p>The web application used to process a particular request is selected by
Catalina based on matching the longest possible prefix of the request URI
against the "context path" of each defined Context.  Once selected, that
Context will select an appropriate servlet to process the incoming request,
based on the request mapping rules that are also found in the servlet
specification.</p>

<p>You may define as many <b>Context</b> components as you wish, nested
within a <b>Host</b> component in the <code>conf/server.xml</code> file.
Each such Context must have a unique context path, defined by the
<code>path</code> attribute.  In addition, you <b>must</b> define a context
with a path equal to a zero-length string, which becomes the default
web application to process requests when a different context cannot be
matched.  There are also special features of the
<a href="host.html#Special Features">Host</a> configuration that enable
automatic creation of <b>Context</b> components without having to explicitly
mention them.</p>

<br>

<a name="Common Attributes"></a>
<h2>Common Attributes</h2>

<p>All implementations of the <b>Context</b> component support the following
attributes, which can be defined in a <code>&lt;Context&gt;</code> element:</p>

<table border="1" width="100%">

  <tr>
    <th width="15%">Attribute</th>
    <th width="85%">Description</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>className</code></td>
    <td>Java class name of the implementation to use.  This class must
        implement the <code>org.apache.tomcat.Context</code> interface.  If
        no class name is specified, the standard implementation will be
        used (<code>org.apache.tomcat.core.StandardContext</code>).
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>cookies</code></td>
    <td>
      Set to <code>true</code> if you want cookies to be used for session
      identifier communication (if supported by the client).  Set to
      <code>false</code> if you want to skip even trying session id cookies,
      and rely only on URL rewriting.  If not specified, the default value is
      <code>true</code>.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>docBase</code></td>
    <td>
      The "document base" directory for this web application.  This is the
      pathname of a directory that contains the static resources (such as
      HTML pages and images) for this application, plus a WEB-INF subdirectory
      containing the "web.xml" deployment descriptor and other configuration
      information.  You may specify an absolute pathname to this directory,
      or a pathname that is relative to the "application base" for the
      <a href="host.html">Host</a> within which this application is defined.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>path</code></td>
    <td>
      The context path for this web application, which is matched against
      the beginning of a request URI to select the appropriate application.
      All of the context paths within a particular
      <a href="host.html">Host</a> must be unique.  In addition, you must
      specify a <b>Context</b> with a <code>path</code> equal to a zero-length
      string, which will become the default context for this Host.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>reloadable</code></td>
    <td>
      Set this attribute to <code>true</code> if you wish to have Catalina
      check the classes in <code>WEB-INF/classes</code> and
      <code>WEB-INF/lib</code> for modification, and automatically reload
      this application if a change is detected.  This feature is very useful
      during development; however, it requires significant runtime overhead
      so it is not recommended for production deployment scenarios.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>wrapperClass</code></td>
    <td>
      Java class name of the <code>org.apache.tomcat.Wrapper</code>
      implementation class that will be used for servlets managed by this
      Context.  If not specified, the standard value
      (<code>org.apache.tomcat.core.StandardWrapper</code>) will be used.
    </td>
  </tr>

</table>

<br>

<a name="Standard Implementation Attributes"></a>
<h2>Standard Implementation Attributes</h2>

<p>The standard implementation of the <b>Context</b> component supports the
following attributes in addition to those supported by all implementations:
</p>

<table border="1" width="100%">

  <tr>
    <th width="15%">Attribute</th>
    <th width="85%">Description</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>debug</code></td>
    <td>
      The level of debugging detail logged by this Engine to the associated
      Logger, with higher numbers generating more detailed output.  If not
      specified, the debugging detail level will be set to zero (0).
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>workDir</code></td>
    <td>
      Pathname to a scratch directory to be provided by this Context for
      temporary read-write use by servlets within this application.  The
      corresponding directory will be made visible as a servlet context
      attribute (of type <code>java.io.File</code>) with the standard name
      assigned by the Servlet API Specification, version 2.2
      (<code>javax.servlet.context.tempdir</code>).  If not specified, a
      suitable directory underneath Catalina's home directory will be
      assigned automatically.
    </td>
  </tr>

</table>

<br>

<a name="Utility Components"></a>
<h2>Utility Components</h2>

<p>You can attach one or more of the following utility components by nesting
a corresponding declaration element inside your <b>Context</b> element.  If
you do not specify a utility component element, your Context will inherit the
corresponding component (if any) from its parent Host.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="loader.html">Loader</a> - Configure a class loader associated
      with this <b>Context</b>.
  <li><a href="logger.html">Logger</a> - Configure a logger that will receive
      all log messages from this <b>Context</b>, as well as from all servlets
      running within this <b>Context</b>.</li>
  <li><a href="manager.html">Manager</a> - Configure a session manager
      for the sessions associated with this <b>Context</b>.</li>
  <li><a href="realm.html">Realm</a> - Configure a realm that will allow your
      database of users, and their associated roles, to be looked up as needed
      by the web application running in this <b>Context</b>.</li>
  <li><a href="resources.html">Resources</a> - Configure access to the static
      resources associated with this <b>Context</b></li>
</ul>

<a name="Special Features"></a>
<h2>Special Features</h2>

<h3>Access Logs</h3>

<p>When you run a web server, one of the output files normally generated is
an <i>access log</i>, which generates one line of information, in a standard
format, for each HTTP request that was received, and responded to, by the
web server.  Catalina includes an optional <a href="valve.html">Valve</a>
implementation that can create access logs in the same standard format
created by web servers, or in any custom format desired.</p>

<p>You can ask Catalina to create an access log for all requests to the
web application running within this <b>Context</b>, by nesting an element
like this inside your <b>Context</b> element:</p>
<pre>

    &lt;Context path="/myapp" ...&gt;
      ...
      &lt;Valve className="org.apache.tomcat.valves.AccessLogValve"
             prefix="localhost_myapp_access_log." suffix=".txt"
             pattern="common"/&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/Context&gt;

</pre>

<p>See <a href="valve.html#FIXME">Access Log Valve</a> for more
information on the configuration options that are supported.</p>

<h3>Automatic Context Configuration</h3>

<p>If you use the standard <b>Context</b> implementation, the following
configuration occurs automatically when Catalina is started, or whenever
this web application is restarted.  No special configuration is necessary
to enable this activity.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have not declared your own <a href="loader.html">Loader</a>
    to be installed, an instance of the standard Loader implementation class
    (<code>org.apache.tomcat.loader.StandardLoader</code>) will be
    installed and configured.</li>
<li>If you have not declared your own <a href="manager.html">Manager</a>
    to be installed, an instance of the standard Manager implementation class
    (<code>org.apache.tomcat.session.StandardManager</code>) will be
    installed and configured.</li>
<li>If you have not declared your own <a href="resources.html">Resources</a>
    to be installed, an instance of the standard Resources implementation class
    (<code>org.apache.tomcat.resources.StandardResources</code>) will be
    installed and configured.</li>
<li>The web application properties for this application will be initialized
    from the <code>conf/web.xml</code> file.  This deployment descriptor can
    therefore be used to establish defaults for servlet mappings (such as the
    JSP servlet) and MIME types for all applications running in Catalina.</li>
<li>The web application properties for this application will then be
    customized from the <code>WEB-INF/web.xml</code> file for this application,
    if it exists.  Such configuration information supplements that provided by
    the system-wide defaults described in the previous point.</li>
<li>If your web application has specified any security constraints, and you
    have not installed any Valves that implement the <code>Authenticator</code>
    interface, a standard <code>Authenticator</code> Valve will be installed,
    based on the selected &lt;auth-method&gt; you have specified.</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE:  The automatic context configuration steps described above are applied
both to contexts specifically listed in the <code>conf/server.xml</code> file,
as well as contexts automatically created by the owning
<a href="host.html">Host</a> component.</p>

<h3>Lifecycle Listeners</h3>

<p>If you have implemented a Java object that needs to know when this Context
is started or stopped, you can declare it by nesting a
<code>&lt;Listener&gt;</code> element inside the <code>&lt;Context&gt;</code>
element.  The class you specify in the <code>className</code> attribute
of this Listener must implement the
<code>org.apache.tomcat.LifecycleListener</code> interface, and it will be
notified about the occurrence of the corresponding lifecycle events.</p>

<p>Configuration for such a listener might look like this:</p>
<pre>

    &lt;Context path="/myapp" ...&gt;
      ...
      &lt;Listener className="com.mycompany.MyContextListener"/&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/Context&gt;

</pre>

<p>See <a href="listener.html">Listeners</a> for more information about
lifecycle listeners.</p>

<h3>Request Filters</h3>

<p>You can ask Catalina to check the IP address, or host name, of an
incoming request for this particular web application
against a list of "accept" and "deny" filters, which are
defined using the Regular Expression syntax supported by the jakarta-regexp
regular expression library system.  Requests that come from remote locations
that are not accepted will be rejected with an HTTP "Forbidden" error.  An
example configuration that rejects requests from any domain
except "mycompany.com" would be:</p>
<pre>

    &lt;Context path="/myapp" ...&gt;
      ...
      &lt;Valve className="org.apache.tomcat.valves.RemoteHostValve"
             allow="*.mycompany.com"/&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/Context&gt;

</pre>

<p>See <a href="valve.html#FIXME">Request Filter Valve</a> for more
information on the syntax of the filters, and the logic that is applied
when they are executed.</p>
