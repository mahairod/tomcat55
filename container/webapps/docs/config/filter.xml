<section name="Introduction">

  <p>Tomcat provides a number of <strong>Filters</strong> which may be
  configured for use with all web applications using
  <code>$CATALINA_BASE/conf/web.xml</code> or may be configured for individual
  web applications by configuring them in the application's
  <code>WEB-INF/web.xml</code>. Each filter is described below.</p>

    <blockquote><em>
    <p>This description uses the variable name $CATALINA_BASE to refer the
    base directory against which most relative paths are resolved. If you have
    not configured Tomcat for multiple instances by setting a CATALINA_BASE
    directory, then $CATALINA_BASE will be set to the value of $CATALINA_HOME,
    the directory into which you have installed Tomcat.</p>

<section name="Failed Request Filter">

  <subsection name="Introduction">

    <p>This filter triggers parameters parsing in a request and rejects the
    request if some parameters were skipped during parameter parsing because
    of parsing errors or request size limitations (such as
    <code>maxParameterCount</code> attribute in a
    <a href="http.html">Connector</a>).
    This filter can be used to ensure that none parameter values submitted by
    client are lost.</p>

    <p>Note that parameter parsing may consume the body of an HTTP request, so
    caution is needed if the servlet protected by this filter uses
    <code>request.getInputStream()</code> or <code>request.getReader()</code>
    calls. In general the risk of breaking a web application by adding this
    filter is not so high, because parameter parsing does check content type
    of the request before consuming the request body.</p>

    <p>The request is rejected with HTTP status code 400 (Bad Request).</p>

  </subsection>

  <subsection name="Filter Class Name">

    <p>The filter class name for the Failed Request Filter is
    <strong><code>org.apache.catalina.filters.FailedRequestFilter</code>
    </strong>.</p>

  </subsection>

  <subsection name="Initialisation parameters">

    <p>The Failed Request Filter does not support any initialization parameters.</p>
