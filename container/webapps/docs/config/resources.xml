<section name="Introduction">

  <p>The <strong>Resources</strong> element represents the <em>web
  application static resources</em>, from which classes will be loaded, 
  HTML, JSP and the other static files will be served. This allows the webapp
  to reside on various mediums other than the filesystem, like compressed
  in a WAR file, in a JDBC database, or in a more advanced versioning
  repository.</p>

  <p>A unified caching engine is provided for all accesses to the webapp
  resources made by the servlet container and web applications which use the
  container provided mechanisms to access such resources, such as class laoder
  access, access through the <code>ServletContext</code> interface, or native
  access through the <code>DirectoryContext</code> interface.</p>

  <p><strong>Note: Running a webapp with non-filesystem based 
  Resources implementations is only possible when the webapp does not 
  rely on direct filesystem access to its own resources, and uses the methods
  in the ServletContext interface to access them.</strong></p>

  <p>A Resources element MAY be nested inside a 
  <a href="context.html">Context</a> component.  If it is not included, 
  a default filesystem based Resources will be created automatically, 
  which is sufficient for most requirements.</p>

<section name="Attributes">

  <subsection name="Common Attributes">

    <p>All implementations of <strong>Resources</strong>
    support the following attributes:</p>

    <attributes>

      <attribute name="className" required="false">
        <p>Java class name of the implementation to use.  This class must
        implement the <code>javax.naming.directory.DirContext</code> interface.
        It is recommended for optimal functionality and performance, 
        but not mandatory, that the class extend 
        <code>org.apache.naming.resources.BaseDirContext</code>, as well as
        use the special object types provided in the 
        <code>org.apache.naming.resources</code> for returned objects.
        If not specified, the standard value (defined below) will be used.</p>
      </attribute>

  <subsection name="Standard Implementation">

    <p>The standard implementation of <strong>Resources</strong> is
    <strong>org.apache.naming.resources.FileDirContext</strong>.
    It supports the following additional attributes (in addition to the
    common attributes listed above):</p>

    <attributes>

      <attribute name="allowLinking" required="false">
        <p>If the value of this flag is <code>true</code>, symlinks will be
        allowed inside the web application, pointing to resources outside the
        web application base path. If not specified, the default value
        of the flag is <code>false</code>.</p>
        <p><b>NOTE: This flag MUST NOT be set to true on the Windows platform
        (or any other OS which does not have a case sensitive filesystem),
        as it will disable case sensitivity checks, allowing JSP source code
        disclosure, among other security problems.</b></p>
      </attribute>

      <attribute name="cached" required="false">
        <p>This boolean flag indicates if the resources should be cached. It
        defaults to <code>true</code>.</p>
      </attribute>

      <attribute name="cacheMaxSize" required="false">
        <p>Maximum size in kilobytes (KB) of the cache associated with 
        the resources, if cached is set to true. It defaults 
        to <code>10240</code> (10 megabytes).</p>
      </attribute>

      <attribute name="cacheTTL" required="false">
        <p>Amount of time in milliseconds between cache entries revalidation.
        If not specified, the default value is <code>5000</code> 
        (5 seconds).</p>
      </attribute>

      <attribute name="caseSensitive" required="false">
        <p>This boolean flag toggles case sensitivity checks. 
        Defaults to <code>true</code>.</p>
        <p><b>NOTE: This flag MUST NOT be set to false on the Windows platform
        (or any other OS which does not have a case sensitive filesystem),
        as it will disable case sensitivity checks, allowing JSP source code
        disclosure, among other security problems.</b></p>
      </attribute>

      <attribute name="docBase" required="false">
        <p>This is the functional equivalent to the <em>Document Base</em> 
        of a <a href="context.html">Context</a>.</p>
      </attribute>
