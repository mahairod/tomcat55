<title>Balancer Webapp Overview</title>
</head>
<body>
The balancer webapp is an implementation of a rules-based
load balancer.  A number of rules are provided and the
application is written for easy extensibility.  

<p>
A servlet filter is also provided along with a sample web.xml that
maps that filter to all requests.  This is only one way
to use the load balancer.  The user may configure multiple
filters each with a different rule chain mapped to 
(possibly multiple) different url-patterns or servlets.  It
is also possible to use rule chains within a servlet.
</p>

<p>
Please note that although this application is being distributed
with Tomcat, it is compliant with the Servlet Specification v2.3
and is therefore portable across servlet containers that support
this specification.
</p>

<p>
The balancer webapps uses the 
<a href="http://commons.apache.org/digester/">Digester</a> 
tool from Apache Commons.  Digester and its dependencies are
included in this distribution.
</p>

<p>
The balancer webapp uses 
<a href="http://jalopy.sf.net">Jalopy</a> 
for source-code formatting and 
<a href="http://checkstyle.sf.net">CheckStyle</a> 
for source-code checking.
<br/>
The <a href="../checkStyle/checkStyleReport.html">
CheckStyle Report</a> is available.
