<title>org.apache.webapp.balancer Package Overview</title>
</head>
<body>
This package contains all classes used by the balancer
webapp other than actual rule implementations.
<p>
The {@link org.apache.webapp.balancer.BalancerFilter Filter} is how the webapp
is typically used: see the web.xml file in this distribution
for an example.
</p>

<p>
A {@link org.apache.webapp.balancer.RuleChain} is simply a list of rules to be
evaluated in order.
</p>

<p>
The {@link org.apache.webapp.balancer.RulesParser} uses 
<a href="http://commons.apache.org/digester/">Digester</a> 
to parse the rules configuration file.
