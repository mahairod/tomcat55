<section name="Overview">

<p>This manual contains reference information about all of the configuration
directives that can be included in a <code>conf/server.xml</code> file to
configure the behavior of the Tomcat 4 servlet/JSP container.  It does not
attempt to describe which configuration directives should be used to perform
specific tasks - for that, see the <em>Server Configuration Guide</em> and
related documents.  (TODO - will need hyperlink(s) to this).</p>

<p>TODO - add some verbage about the overall organization of conf/server.xml
and the valid nesting that is allowed.</p>

<p>TODO - add a brief description of the categories of elements listed in
the navigation menu (top level, connectors, containers, nested).</p>
