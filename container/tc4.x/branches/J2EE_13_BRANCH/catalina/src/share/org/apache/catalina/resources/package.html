<p>This package contains <code>Resources</code> implementations for the
various supported repositories for static resource files.  They may be used
(by a <code>Context</code> implementation) in implementing the following
API calls:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>public URL getResource(String path)</b></li>
<li><b>publid InputStream getResourceAsStream(String path)</b></li>
</ul>

<p>The implementations share a common base class that supports caching of
resources where appropriate.  Caching (and other features) of all the
standard <code>Resources</code> implementations are configured by setting
the following properties (default values are in square brackets):</p>
<ul>
<li><b>checkInterval</b> - The interval, in seconds, between checks by our
    background thread for out-of-date cached resources, or zero for no
    checks.  [0]</li>
<li><b>debug</b> - Debugging detail level that controls our logging, where
    zero means no debugging messages and higher numbers mean more deatail.
    [0]</li>
<li><b>docBase</b> - The document base for this <code>Resources</code>
    implementation, which must follow the syntax specified for each
    individual implementation.  This property is transparently duplicated
    from the <code>docBase</code> property of the <code>Context</code>
    we are associated with.  [REQUIRED - NO DEFAULT]
<li><b>expand</b> - Should getResource() calls for a "directory" return a
    directory listing (if "true") or nothing (if "false")?
    [true]</li>
<li><b>maxCount</b> - The maximum number of resources to cache, or zero
    for no limit.  [0]
<li><b>maxSize</b> - The maximum size (in bytes) of resources to cache, or
    zero for no limit.  [0]
<li><b>minSize</b> - The minimum size (in bytes) of resources to cache, or
    zero for no limit.  [0]
</ul>

<p>The standard <code>Resources</code> implementations that are currently
available include the following (with additional configuration properties
as specified):</p>
<ul>
<li><b>FileResources</b> - Implementation of <code>Resources</code> that
    operates off a document base that is a directory in the server's
    local filesystem.  The document base must specify a relative or absolute
    pathname.  If it is relative, it is resolved against the application
    base for our surrounding <code>Host</code> (if any), or against the
    value of the "catalina.home" system property.  Files can be added, removed,
    or modified within this directory while the application runs -- a
    background thread periodically checks the last modified time of all
    cached resources and un-caches entries that have been modified, so that
    the updated version will be processed the next time it is requested.</li>
<li><b>JarResources</b> - Implementation of <code>Resources</code> that
    operates off a web application archive (WAR) file directly.  In this
    environment, there is no concept of "file paths" to the various entries,
    so <code>getRealPath()</code> will always return <code>null</code>.  In
    addition, this implementation assumes that the individual entries in the
    WAR file, or the WAR file itself, will not be modified while the
    application is running -- therefore, no checking for out-of-date cache
    entries is required.  Caching is still performed, subject to the policies
    enforced by the <code>cacheable()</code> method, because the JAR file
    itself might be on a remote server.</li>
</ul>
