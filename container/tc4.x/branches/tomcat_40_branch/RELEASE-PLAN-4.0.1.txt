                     Release Plan for Apache Tomcat 4.0.1
                     ====================================


Introduction:
------------

This document is a release plan for a maintenance release of Tomcat 4.0. This 
release will address a few important issues which have been uncovered since 
the release of Tomcat 4.0, as well as a number of fixes for bugs and 
compliance issues. None of these problems are showstoppers, and justified an
emergency release.

The following schedule is proposed:

  Sunday, October 7, 2001       Tomcat 4.0.1 Beta

  Monday, October 15, 2001      Tomcat 4.0.1 Release

If for some reason new issues are found which need significant patches to be 
addressed, additional beta releases will be made, and this release plan will be
updated.

As usual with a mainenance release, there should be no regressions from 4.0 to
4.0.1, and no open confirmed P1 or P2 bugs in the Bugzilla database. The 
Apache bug database can be accessed at:

  http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/

Please review the bug reports, and their classification as "must have",
"nice to have", or "address later".  Lobbying for changes in classification
can take place on the TOMCAT-DEV mailling list.  In addition, if you have a
bug report or enhancement that you wish to have considered prior to final
release, please submit a bug report as quickly as possible.
